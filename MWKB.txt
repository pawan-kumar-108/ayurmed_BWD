What is Mental Wellness & How to Improve It
When you hear the words “mental wellness,” you might be tempted to think this defines a state of consistent happiness. But it’s more than that. The human body, brain, and lifestyle must perform a complicated dance that makes room for many emotions. The key to mental wellness is—instead of staying consistently happy—passing through these many life events and emotions with a sense of equilibrium. 
 
Read on to find out what mental wellness looks like, and how to improve mental wellness in your own life. 
 
What is Mental Wellness?
The World Health Organization provides a mental wellness definition: “A state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.” 
Notice how this definition says nothing about happiness. It’s also not defined as the absence of mental illness. 
Rather, mental wellness means you are able to adequately cope with the stresses life throws at you, whether that be as simple as a work project or as complicated as a breakup. 
It’s the balance between your emotional, physical, spiritual, and mental self.
How Can I Improve My Mental Wellness?
Not sure if you pass the mental wellness check? Experiencing one or more of these symptoms on an on-going basis may be an early warning sign of a greater problem:
* Eating or sleeping too much or too little
* Pulling away from people and usual activities
* Having low or no energy
* Feeling numb or like nothing matters
* Having unexplained aches and pains
* Feeling helpless or hopeless
* Smoking, drinking, or using drugs more than usual
* Feeling unusually on edge, angry, upset, worried, or scared
* Yelling or fighting with family and friends
* Experiencing severe mood swings
* Thinking of harming yourself or others
* Inability to perform daily tasks
 
If you or a loved one experience one or more of these symptoms, it may be time to shift your focus to improving your mental wellness. Improving mental wellness can look different for every individual, but there are some guidelines to follow if you want to work on improving mental wellness. These include:
* Allowing yourself to seek professional help if you need it
* Staying in contact with friends, family, and your community
* Finding ways to keep a positive outlook
* Incorporating physical exercise into your routine
* Volunteering or helping others
* Developing coping skills that are right for you
 
How to Boost Your Mental Health?
The key to boosting mental health is about focusing on different areas of your life, one at a time. For example, one week can be spent performing activities like yoga, mindfulness, and meditation—these can help you live “in the moment.” This means letting go of past and future worries and focusing only on what’s going on in the here and now.
The next week can be spent looking at resting and relaxation. Though keeping busy is wonderful, make sure you’re taking breaks and not being too hard on yourself. Lack of rest, both physically and mentally, can lead to burnout and unhealthy coping mechanisms.
Another week can be spent focusing on time with loved ones. This is a wonderful way to boost mental health. A day with your best friend or family can help you better cope with trauma, increase your self esteem, and enhance your mood.
 
5 Activities That Improve Mental Health
There are concrete activities you can do to work on your mental wellness and balance your mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional self. Here are five to get you started:
1. Feed your brain. When life gets hectic, it’s tempting to override your own needs for work, your social life, or other prerogatives. But your dietary health is important. Find out what foods make you feel best and stick to them.
1. Get your blood pumping. Exercise triggers endorphins—the ‘feel good’ chemical—to flood through your brain, as well as reduce cortisol—the chemical that causes stress. Try to get in at least 15 minutes of exercise a day. 
1. Plan your sleeping schedule and stick to it. Most adults need 7–9 hours of sleep. If you have trouble resting, it may help to create morning and nighttime routines around sleep, such as stretching, journaling, showering, reading, or any activity that helps you wind down at night and wake up in the morning. 
1. Do something you excel at. Are you an amazing painter? Focused musician? Speedy runner? Get that adrenaline rush that comes out of doing something well and knowing it. Don’t know what you’re good at yet? Even better. Explore all kinds of hobbies and passions until you find something that clicks.
1. Ask for help when you need help. No matter what you’re going through, big or small, you’re not alone. Don’t feel like you have to be strong and push through your issues; make sure you have a strong support network, or healthcare professional, to talk it out.
 
Mental Wellness for Overall Wellness
While there is no cure-all or magic formula to mental health and mental wellness, there are many different tools and strategies at your disposal. Not all of them will work for you, but trying multiple techniques will help you find your own secret formula for success.
As the old adage goes: If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.

MENTAL WELLNESS
What Is Mental Wellness?

What Is Mental Wellness?
Mental wellness is an internal resource that helps us think, feel, connect, and function; it is an active process that helps us to build resilience, grow, and flourish.
Mental wellness is a resource because it is dynamic, renewable, and positive.
Mental wellness is a process that we must engage in proactively, it is not a static state of being.
Mental wellness is not only "mental" but has several dimensions:
THINKING
Mental Dimension
FEELING
Emotional Dimension
CONNECTING
Social Dimension
FUNCTIONING
Psychological Dimension
Five Key Things to Know About Mental Wellness
1. Mental wellness is more than just the absence of mental illness.
The complex relationship between mental illness and mental wellness is best understood by envisioning them sitting on two separate continuums (see figure below). The horizontal axis measures mental illness from high to low, while the vertical axis measures mental wellness from languishing to flourishing. About 85% of the world’s population does not have a diagnosed mental illness, but these people are not all “mentally well” or thriving because of pervasive stress, worry, loneliness and other challenges. On the other hand, those who have a diagnosed mental disorder can still have moderate or positive mental wellness (e.g., having good relationships, feeling happy, or functioning well at a job). Practices that increase our mental wellness are increasingly recognized as protective factors for our mental health, as well as helping reduce the severity and symptoms of mental illness (alongside conventional treatment regimens).

2. Mental wellness is an active process of moving from languishing to resilience to flourishing.
On one level, mental wellness is about prevention; coping with life’s adversity; and being resilient when we face stress, worry, loneliness, anger and sadness. On another level, mental wellness moves us toward a deeper, richer and more meaningful human experience, which is often described as flourishing. What it means to flourish is subjective and personal, and it is shaped by individual values, culture, religion and beliefs. For one person, it can mean functioning at the top of their game and achieving their life goals, while for another, it might mean self-transcendence.
3. Mental wellness helps to shift the perspective away from stigma to shared humanity.
Even though the mental health field has done a lot of work to mitigate the stigma surrounding mental illness, a sense of shame, denial and secrecy continues to afflict people in communities and cultures around the world. Mental wellness can help shift our focus toward a more positive and empowering approach (how we can feel, think, connect and function better), rather than just avoiding or coping with illness. It emphasizes our capacity to build resilience; to reduce suffering; to find inner peace and joy; and to seek meaning, purpose and connection—a universal longing shared by all people.
4. Mental wellness grows out of a grassroots, consumer-driven movement.
People desperately need non-clinical, non-pathologizing strategies to cope with everyday mental and emotional challenges like stress, burnout, loneliness and sadness. Evidence shows that improving our mental wellness can even reduce our risk of developing mental illness, but not enough attention is paid globally to mental illness prevention and mental wellness promotion. Consumers, practitioners and businesses have led the charge in seeking self-directed, alternative solutions outside of the established fields of medicine, psychiatry and psychology. They are bringing centuries-old natural and holistic mental wellness modalities into the mainstream, pushing science into areas where it has not gone before to consider the efficacy of ancient practices and emerging solutions.

Mental Illness/ Health			VS.			Mental Wellness/ Well-being
Pathogenic							Salutogenic
Clinical Care							Self Care
Stigma, Isolating						Empowering, Shared Humanity
Scientific & Objective						Personal & Subjective
* Mental wellness can mitigate mental illness.
* Mental illness and wellness can co-exist.
* Mental Wellness can mitigate mental illness.

5. Mental wellness is multi-dimensional, holistic and personal.
Mental wellness recognizes the integrated and holistic nature of our health and wellbeing. The state of our mind affects our body and vice versa. Sometimes, when our circumstances change, we need to adopt new practices or strategies to handle stress, improve resilience, and deal with adversity. In this study, we segment the key strategies for mental wellness into four main pathways: activity and creativity, growth and nourishment, rest and rejuvenation, and connection and meaning. Each of these has mind-body and internal-external dimensions (see figure below). Together, they represent a menu of options for pursuing mental wellness; there is no set path, and people can choose the strategies and activities that are the most important or effective for them.

The Mental Wellness Economy
GWI defines the mental wellness economy as consumer spending on activities, products and services whose primary aim is to help us along the mental wellness pathways of growth and nourishment and rest and rejuvenation. It encompasses four subsectors:
* Self-improvement
* Brain-boosting nutraceutical and botanicals
* Meditation and mindfulness
* Senses, spaces and sleep
GWI estimates that the global mental wellness industry was worth $120.8 billion in 2019 (see figure below). This estimate represents consumer expenditures on the four subsectors that we have defined as part of the mental wellness industry; it focuses on proactive, wellness-focused, consumer- and private sector-driven activities (that is, things outside of the psychiatry, psychology and clinical/medical spheres). These figures are broad, global estimates that we aggregated based on a wide range of secondary data sources.

A cluttered environment can lead to stress and anxiety, making it difficult to fall asleep. It’s essential to keep your sleep space tidy and organized to promote relaxation and better mental wellness.
In addition to these tips, it’s crucial to remove any distractions from your sleep space. Keep technology, work-related items, and other distractions away from your bed.
By following these tips, you can create a sleep-enhancing environment that promotes optimal mental health.
Sleep and Mental health: Prioritize Sleep Hygiene and Mental Wellness
Having a consistent sleep schedule and a sleep-enhancing environment is essential for restful and rejuvenating sleep.
However, there is another critical aspect of obtaining quality sleep, and that is sleep hygiene. Sleep hygiene refers to habits and practices that ensure our sleep is conducive to promoting optimal physical and mental health.
Sleep and Mental health -Sleep Smarter, Live Better:
Sleep hygiene practices include maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine before bedtime, and limiting daytime napping.
Additionally, regulating exposure to light and keeping the sleep environment quiet, dark, and cool promote better sleep.
Not prioritizing sleep hygiene can lead to sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome, which can significantly impact our mental health by increasing anxiety, depression, and mood disorders.

Sleep DisordersImpact on Mental HealthInsomniaIncreased risk of depression and anxiety.Sleep ApneaIncreased risk of depression and irritability.Restless Leg SyndromeIncreased risk of depression and anxiety.Thus, it is vital to prioritize sleep hygiene and adopt practices that ensure restorative sleep, promoting optimal physical and mental health.

Unlocking the Link: Sleep and Mental Health in the Context of Depression
Depression is a serious mental health condition that can affect anyone. Many factors contribute to the development of depression, including genetics, environmental stressors, and chemical imbalances in the brain. However, sleep also plays a significant role in depression.
Studies have shown that people with depression often experience sleep disturbances, such as insomnia or hypersomnia. These disruptions can worsen depression symptoms, making it harder to feel rested and energized during the day.
On the other hand, high-quality sleep has been linked to several mental health benefits, including improved mood and cognitive function.
By prioritizing sleep hygiene and following the three-step blueprint, we can promote better sleep and potentially alleviate some symptoms of depression.
Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule
One of the best ways to improve sleep quality is to establish a consistent sleep schedule. By going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, our bodies can regulate our sleep-wake cycle, making it easier to fall asleep at night and wake up feeling refreshed in the morning. Be sure to stick to this schedule, even on weekends or days off work.
Create a Sleep-Enhancing Environment
The sleep environment is critical to sleep quality. To create an optimal sleep environment, try to keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.
Use comfortable bedding and consider investing in a good-quality mattress and pillows. Avoid using electronic devices in bed and turn off all electronics at least an hour before bedtime to limit exposure to blue light, which can interfere with sleep.
Prioritize Sleep Hygiene and Mental Wellness
Lastly, prioritize sleep hygiene and mental wellness. This includes developing healthy sleep habits, such as avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, engaging in regular physical activity, and managing stress levels. By taking care of our minds and bodies, we can promote better sleep and improve our overall mental health.

Sleep and Mental Health- The link between Sleep and Anxiety
It’s no secret that anxiety can disrupt sleep, often causing insomnia or other sleep disturbances. This can further exacerbate anxiety symptoms, creating a vicious cycle that can be challenging to break. However, there are strategies we can employ to manage sleep disturbances related to anxiety.
Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule
One of the most effective ways to promote better sleep is by maintaining a consistent sleep schedule. This means going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. By following a regular sleep routine, our body’s internal clock can effectively regulate our sleep and wake cycles.
Create a Sleep-Enhancing Environment
Creating an environment that promotes relaxation can also improve sleep quality. Bedroom temperature, lighting, and noise levels can all affect our ability to fall and stay asleep.
Consider using blackout curtains, comfortable bedding, and relaxing scents like lavender to create a sleep-promoting atmosphere.
Prioritize Sleep Hygiene and Mental Wellness
Practicing healthy sleep habits, such as avoiding caffeine and alcohol, not eating heavy meals before bedtime, and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine, can also improve sleep quality.
Additionally, managing stress and anxiety through activities like meditation, exercise, therapy, and medication can have a significant impact on both mental health and sleep quality.

“It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.” – John Steinbeck
Harmony in Health: Navigating Sleep and Mental Health to Tackle Stress
Stress can significantly impact your ability to sleep well, and poor sleep can make stress levels worse, creating a vicious cycle.
When we’re stressed, our bodies release cortisol, a hormone that can make it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. Here are some practical tips to help improve your sleep and reduce stress:
Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule
Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day can help regulate your body’s sleep-wake cycle, making it easier to fall asleep at night. Avoiding electronics and caffeine before bedtime can also promote better sleep.

Creating a sleep-enhancing environment can promote better sleep and cognitive function. Keep the bedroom dark, quiet, and cool, and invest in comfortable pillows and mattresses.
Avoid screen time for 30 minutes before bed and limit noise and light pollution from outside sources.
Prioritize Sleep Hygiene and Mental Wellness
Prioritizing sleep hygiene practices can also support cognitive function and overall mental wellness. Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, exercise regularly, and manage stress and anxiety levels through relaxation techniques like meditation and deep breathing exercises.
“Sleep is that golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.” – Thomas Dekker
Sleep and Mental Health: Sleep Disorders and Mental Illness
Sleep disorders and mental illnesses are closely linked, with numerous studies highlighting their correlation. Sleep deprivation can worsen the symptoms of mental health conditions, while underlying mental health issues can contribute to sleep disturbances.
Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule
People with mental health issues often struggle with maintaining a regular sleep pattern, which can exacerbate their symptoms.
Establishing a consistent sleep schedule can help regulate the body’s internal clock and promote better sleep hygiene, reducing the effects of sleep deprivation on mental well-being.
Create a Sleep-Enhancing Environment
The sleep environment can significantly impact the quality of sleep. People with mental health issues may experience heightened sensitivity to loud noises or bright lights, making it harder for them to fall asleep.
Creating a sleep-enhancing environment that is calm, quiet, and dark can improve the chances of getting quality rest.

Table of Contents
Effects of Poor Sleep on Mental Well-being
Increased risk of depression
Poor sleep quality has been strongly associated with an increased risk of depression. When you consistently experience inadequate or disrupted sleep, it can significantly impact your mood and overall mental well-being. Research suggests that poor sleep can contribute to the development of depressive symptoms, making it more likely for individuals to experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed. Lack of quality sleep can disrupt the brain’s natural chemistry and negatively influence the regulation of emotions, which can ultimately lead to an increased susceptibility to depression.
Higher levels of anxiety
In addition to depression, poor sleep quality is closely linked to higher levels of anxiety. When you don’t get enough restful sleep, your brain may struggle to effectively regulate emotions, leading to increased feelings of worry, nervousness, and fear. Lack of sleep can heighten anxiety symptoms, causing individuals to experience racing thoughts, increased heart rate, and a constant state of alertness. Moreover, poor sleep can exacerbate anxiety disorders, making it more challenging for individuals to manage and cope with their symptoms effectively.
Irritability and mood swings
You’ve probably experienced it before – a sleepless night followed by a day filled with irritability and mood swings. Poor sleep is known to significantly impact your emotional well-being, often leading to heightened irritability and frequent mood swings. When you’re sleep deprived, even minor inconveniences can feel overwhelmingly frustrating, and you may find yourself easily agitated or snapping at others. This emotional volatility can strain relationships and make it more challenging to navigate daily tasks and interactions.
Poor cognitive function
One of the most immediate and noticeable effects of poor sleep on mental well-being is the impairment of cognitive function. Sleep deprivation can lead to difficulties with concentration, attention, memory, and problem-solving skills. When you don’t get enough high-quality sleep, your ability to focus and retain information is compromised, making it harder to perform well at school, work, or any other cognitive tasks. Inadequate sleep can also slow down your reaction times and impair decision-making abilities, which can have significant consequences on your overall mental performance and well-being.
Role of Sleep in Emotional Regulation
Impact on emotional processing
Sleep plays a crucial role in the processing and regulation of emotions. During sleep, your brain undergoes important processes that help consolidate emotional memories and regulate emotional responses. Adequate sleep helps to strengthen positive emotional memories, allowing you to retain positive experiences and emotions more effectively. On the other hand, poor sleep quality can disrupt the brain’s ability to process emotions, making it more challenging to regulate your emotional responses and leading to heightened emotional reactivity.
Regulation of negative emotions
Getting sufficient sleep is essential for effectively regulating negative emotions. During sleep, the brain engages in a process called emotional integration, where it processes and assimilates negative emotions and experiences. This allows you to achieve emotional balance and resilience, helping you cope with everyday stressors and challenges. Inadequate sleep disrupts this process and can result in increased susceptibility to negative emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. Consequently, individuals who experience poor sleep may find it more difficult to manage and regulate negative emotions effectively.
Influence on interpersonal relationships
Sleep also plays a crucial role in interpersonal relationships, as it affects our ability to empathize and communicate effectively. When you’re sleep-deprived, it becomes harder to accurately interpret and understand other people’s emotions, leading to miscommunication and misunderstandings. Moreover, inadequate sleep can impair your ability to express emotions appropriately, potentially causing strain in relationships. Conversely, consistently getting high-quality sleep improves emotional intelligence, allowing for better communication, increased empathy, and deeper connections with others.
Sleep Disorders and Mental Health
Insomnia
Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders and is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing non-refreshing sleep. It is often associated with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. Insomnia can significantly impact your mental well-being, exacerbating symptoms of these conditions and making it harder to manage and recover from them. Additionally, the persistent lack of sleep can contribute to the development of other mental health disorders.
Sleep apnea
Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by interrupted breathing during sleep. It can result in frequent awakenings throughout the night, leading to poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. Research has shown a strong link between sleep apnea and mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. The chronic sleep deprivation caused by sleep apnea can worsen these conditions and increase the risk of developing other mental health issues.
Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the brain’s ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Individuals with narcolepsy often experience excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden sleep attacks, and fragmented nighttime sleep. The disruption of normal sleep patterns can have a significant impact on mental well-being. Narcolepsy is associated with an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. Managing narcolepsy effectively is crucial for maintaining optimal mental health.
Restless legs syndrome
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms usually worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, leading to difficulty falling asleep and maintaining sleep. The resultant sleep disturbances can affect mental well-being, contributing to symptoms of depression and anxiety. Proper management and treatment of RLS are essential in improving sleep quality and overall mental health.

Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Mental Health Disorders
Depression
Sleep deprivation can significantly worsen symptoms of depression. The relationship between poor sleep and depression is bidirectional, with each influencing the other. Depression can lead to difficulties falling asleep or experiencing restful sleep, while inadequate sleep quality can exacerbate depressive symptoms. Furthermore, sleep deprivation can reduce the efficacy of treatments for depression, making it more challenging to recover and maintain stable mental health.
Anxiety disorders
Sleep deprivation can have a detrimental effect on individuals with anxiety disorders. Heightened anxiety can make it difficult to fall asleep, leading to poor sleep quality and a vicious cycle of anxiety and insomnia. The constant state of arousal and hyperarousal associated with anxiety can disrupt sleep patterns and prevent individuals from obtaining the restorative sleep needed to manage their symptoms effectively. Proper sleep hygiene practices and targeted treatment strategies are essential in managing anxiety disorders.
Bipolar disorder
Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with bipolar disorder, with both manic and depressive episodes often associated with disrupted sleep patterns. Lack of sleep can trigger manic episodes and contribute to the severity and duration of the mania experienced by individuals with bipolar disorder. Conversely, depressive episodes can also lead to hypersomnia or insomnia, further affecting sleep quality. Establishing stable and regular sleep patterns is crucial in managing bipolar disorder and promoting better mental health.
Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that can significantly impact sleep patterns. Individuals with schizophrenia often experience disrupted sleep architecture, including decreased total sleep time, increased sleep latency, and altered rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These sleep disturbances can worsen symptoms of schizophrenia and impair cognitive function. Proper sleep management, including medications and therapy, can help improve sleep quality and overall mental well-being for individuals with schizophrenia.
Sleep Quality’s Role in Memory and Learning
Consolidation of memories
Sleep plays a vital role in the consolidation of memories. During sleep, the brain processes and consolidates the information and experiences acquired throughout the day, transferring them from short-term to long-term memory. Adequate sleep facilitates the storage and organization of memories, making it easier to recall information when needed. In contrast, sleep deprivation impairs memory consolidation, leading to difficulties in learning new information and retaining previously learned material.
Enhancement of learning
Getting sufficient sleep is crucial for optimal learning. Studies have consistently shown that sleep contributes to better cognitive function and improved learning outcomes. During sleep, the brain strengthens neural connections, enhances synaptic plasticity, and consolidates new information. This process aids in memory formation and retrieval, allowing for better retention and recall of learned material. Quality sleep enables individuals to approach learning tasks with improved focus, attention, and mental clarity.
Effects on creativity
Sleep quality also plays a role in creativity. The brain engages in various cognitive processes during sleep, including memory processing and problem-solving. These processes can lead to novel connections and creative insights. Additionally, REM sleep, known as the dream stage, is associated with enhanced creativity and the integration of new and diverse information. Sleep deprivation can hinder creative thinking, limiting the brain’s ability to generate unique ideas and solutions.
Sleep as a Protective Factor for Mental Health
Reducing the risk of developing mental disorders
Maintaining good sleep hygiene and consistently getting enough restful sleep can act as protective factors against the development of mental disorders. Adequate sleep supports optimal brain functioning, emotional regulation, and cognitive processes, all of which contribute to overall mental well-being. By prioritizing sleep and implementing healthy sleep practices, you can reduce the risk of developing mental health disorders and promote a more resilient mind.
Preventing cognitive decline
As we age, the risk of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders increases. However, good sleep quality can exert a protective effect against cognitive decline. Adequate sleep helps to maintain cognitive function and prevent age-related cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. During sleep, the brain clears toxic waste products accumulated during waking hours, facilitating proper brain health and preserving cognitive abilities. Consistent, high-quality sleep is crucial in preserving cognitive function and promoting healthy brain aging.
Enhancing overall well-being
Quality sleep is essential for maintaining overall well-being, including mental health. Sufficient and restorative sleep improves mood, boosts energy levels, and enhances resilience to stress. When you prioritize sleep and consistently achieve good sleep quality, you’ll notice improvements in your mood, mental clarity, and overall mental well-being. Sleep serves as a foundation for a healthy mind and body, allowing you to function optimally and face life’s challenges with greater emotional stability.
Sleep Hygiene Practices for Improving Mental Health
Establishing a consistent sleep schedule
Setting a consistent sleep schedule can improve both the quantity and quality of your sleep. Aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends. This regularity helps regulate your body’s internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up feeling refreshed. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule also promotes better sleep efficiency and overall sleep quality.
Creating a sleep-friendly environment
Optimizing your sleep environment can significantly improve the quality of your sleep. Ensure that your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet, creating an environment conducive to sleep. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows that support healthy spinal alignment. Minimize electronic devices in the bedroom, as the blue light they emit can disrupt sleep patterns. By creating a sleep-friendly environment, you signal to your body that it’s time to relax and prepare for restful sleep.
Managing stress and relaxation techniques
Stress can significantly impact your sleep quality and overall mental health. Implementing effective stress management techniques can help improve your sleep. Engage in relaxation practices such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga before bed to promote relaxation and reduce stress levels. Creating a pre-sleep routine that includes activities you find calming and enjoyable can also help signal your body to wind down and prepare for sleep.
Avoiding stimulants and creating a bedtime routine
The consumption of stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine can negatively affect sleep quality. Limit or avoid these substances, especially in the evening, to ensure they don’t interfere with your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. Instead, establish a calming bedtime routine that signals to your body that it’s time to transition from wakefulness to sleep. Engaging in relaxing activities such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretching can promote a more peaceful and restful sleep.
Impact of Age and Gender on Sleep Quality and Mental Well-being
Sleep patterns and quality in different age groups
Sleep patterns and quality vary across different age groups. Infants and young children require a substantial amount of sleep to support their growth and development. As individuals reach adolescence, their sleep patterns undergo alterations, with delayed bedtimes and later wake-up times. The sleep needs of adults differ, generally requiring 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Older adults may experience changes in sleep architecture and may have more fragmented sleep patterns. These variations in sleep needs and patterns can influence mental well-being throughout different stages of life.
Gender differences in sleep and mental health
Gender can also influence sleep quality and mental well-being. Generally, women tend to experience poorer sleep quality compared to men. Hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause can greatly impact sleep in women. Additionally, societal and cultural factors can affect sleep quality, with women often taking on multiple roles and responsibilities that can interfere with their sleep. Sleep disturbances in women can contribute to the development of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Understanding and addressing these gender-specific factors are essential in promoting better sleep and mental well-being for all individuals.
Sleep Interventions for Mental Health Treatment
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a widely recognized and effective intervention for improving sleep quality and managing insomnia. CBT-I combines cognitive and behavioral techniques to address underlying thoughts, behaviors, and emotions that contribute to sleep disturbances. This therapy helps individuals develop healthier sleep habits, manage anxiety about sleep, and challenge negative thought patterns that hinder quality sleep. CBT-I offers long-lasting benefits and can be an effective alternative or complement to medication for treating sleep disorders alongside mental health conditions.
Medication options
In some cases, medication may be prescribed to aid sleep and alleviate symptoms of sleep disorders or mental health conditions. Medications such as sedatives or hypnotics can promote sleep initiation and maintenance. It is important to consult a healthcare professional who can assess your individual needs and prescribe the most appropriate medication. Medication should be used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan and closely monitored to ensure its effectiveness and minimize potential side effects.
Alternative therapies
Various alternative therapies may complement conventional treatment approaches to improve sleep and enhance mental well-being. These therapies include acupuncture, mindfulness meditation, relaxation techniques, and herbal supplements. While research on their effectiveness is ongoing, many individuals find these alternative therapies beneficial in promoting relaxation and healthy sleep. When considering alternative therapies, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional to ensure their safety and to discuss potential interactions with other treatments.
The Importance of Seeking Professional Help
Recognizing signs and symptoms
Recognizing signs and symptoms of sleep disturbances and mental health disorders is important in seeking appropriate professional help. Common signs of poor sleep quality include difficulties falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night, excessive daytime sleepiness, and not feeling rested despite spending an adequate amount of time in bed. Similarly, signs of mental health disorders can manifest as persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, and a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities. Paying attention to these signs can help determine when professional help is needed.
Consulting healthcare professionals
When struggling with sleep disturbances or mental health challenges, it is crucial to consult healthcare professionals. Primary care physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, or sleep specialists can provide a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis. They will work with you to develop an individualized treatment plan that may include therapy, medication, lifestyle modifications, or a combination of approaches. Seeking professional help ensures that you receive accurate diagnoses, appropriate treatment, and ongoing support tailored to your unique needs.
Collaborative approach to treatment
Taking a collaborative approach to treatment is key to optimizing mental well-being and sleep quality. Engage in open communication with healthcare professionals, providing them with comprehensive information about your sleep patterns, mental health symptoms, and any other factors that may influence your well-being. Collaboratively establishing treatment goals, discussing available options, and actively participating in your treatment plan empowers you to take control of your mental health and sleep quality. Remember that finding the right combination of interventions may require ongoing adjustments, and maintaining regular follow-ups with healthcare professionals is essential for long-term success.
In conclusion, sleep quality plays a significant role in mental well-being. Poor sleep can increase the risk of depression and anxiety, lead to irritability and mood swings, and impair cognitive function. Sleep also influences emotional regulation, contributes to memory consolidation and learning, and acts as a protective factor for mental health. Sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and restless legs syndrome can further impact mental health. Sleep deprivation can worsen mental health disorders including depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Implementing good sleep hygiene practices, considering age and gender factors, utilizing sleep interventions, and seeking professional help are important strategies in improving mental well-being through sleep. By prioritizing sleep and taking a proactive approach to managing sleep disturbances, you can enhance your overall mental health and well-being.
How Does Screen Time Affect Our Mental Health?
In this digital age, where screens dominate our daily lives, it’s crucial to explore how screen time impacts our mental well-being. With the constant temptation to check our phones, browse social media, and binge-watch our favorite shows, it’s no wonder that concerns about the effects of excessive screen time on our mental health have arisen. From increased feelings of anxiety and depression to disrupted sleep patterns, the impacts of screen time on our mental well-being cannot be ignored. Understanding how our screen habits affect us is the first step towards finding a healthier balance in our technology-driven world.
Table of Contents
Negative Impact of Excessive Screen Time on Mental Health
Excessive screen time has been found to have numerous negative effects on mental health. By spending excessive amounts of time in front of screens, individuals are at an increased risk of developing depression. Studies have shown that excessive screen time is associated with feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can contribute to the development of depressive symptoms.
Furthermore, excessive screen time can also lead to increased anxiety and stress levels. Constant exposure to social media platforms can create a sense of pressure to present a perfect life and compare oneself to others. This comparison and the pressure to conform to societal standards can lead to low self-esteem and heightened anxiety levels.
Another significant negative impact of excessive screen time is a decreased attention span. The constant stimulation provided by screens, such as scrolling through social media feeds or playing video games, can lead to difficulties in focusing on tasks that require sustained attention. This can impact an individual’s ability to effectively complete work or engage in activities that require concentration.
Poor sleep quality is another consequence of excessive screen time. The blue light emitted by screens can disrupt the natural sleep-wake cycle, making it more difficult to fall asleep and achieve a restful sleep. This can result in fatigue, decreased productivity, and overall impaired well-being.
Moreover, excessive screen time can contribute to social isolation and loneliness. Spending excessive time on screens can lead to a decrease in face-to-face social interactions, as individuals may prioritize online connections over real-life relationships. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, further impacting mental health.
Effects of Social Media on Mental Health
Social media platforms have become deeply ingrained in our lives, but they also come with their own set of negative effects on mental health. One common effect is the feeling of comparison and low self-esteem. Seeing carefully curated images and posts on social media can create unrealistic standards and a sense of inadequacy. Individuals may compare their own lives to the highlight reels of others, leading to a decline in self-esteem and overall mental well-being.
Another significant effect of social media is the fear of missing out (FOMO). Constant exposure to images and updates of others’ experiences can create a feeling of being left out, ultimately leading to anxiety and stress. The fear of missing out on events, outings, or social gatherings portrayed on social media can lead to feelings of inadequacy and isolation.
Furthermore, cyberbullying has emerged as a serious mental health concern associated with social media. Online platforms provide anonymity and a sense of detachment, making it easier for individuals to engage in harmful behaviors. Cyberbullying can cause significant emotional distress, leading to feelings of depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.
Relationship Between Screen Time and ADHD
There is evidence suggesting a relationship between excessive screen time and an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in both children and adults. Excessive screen time can disrupt attention regulation and cognitive control, potentially contributing to the development of ADHD symptoms.
Additionally, excessive screen time can worsen existing ADHD symptoms. The constant stimulation provided by screens can make it even more challenging for individuals with ADHD to focus and concentrate on tasks. It can exacerbate symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity, making it difficult to manage daily activities effectively.
Impact of Screen Time on Cognitive Development
Excessive screen time has been found to have negative effects on cognitive development, particularly in children. One notable impact is the delay in language development. Excessive screen time can limit opportunities for language exposure and social interaction, hindering language acquisition and communication skills.
Furthermore, excessive screen time can reduce problem-solving skills. Continuous passive consumption of content on screens does not require individuals to actively think or engage in problem-solving tasks. This lack of mental stimulation can hinder the development of cognitive abilities, including critical thinking and decision-making skills.
Impaired memory and learning abilities are also associated with excessive screen time. The constant exposure to high-intensity visuals and rapid information processing on screens can overload the brain and hinder information retention. This can lead to difficulties in learning and memory processes, ultimately impacting academic performance and overall cognitive functioning.
Screen Time and Physical Health Consequences
Excessive screen time is not only detrimental to mental health but also impacts physical well-being. Spending excessive hours in front of screens often leads to a sedentary lifestyle, with individuals becoming less physically active. This lack of physical activity can contribute to weight gain, leading to obesity and related health issues such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
Another physical health consequence of excessive screen time is eye strain and digital eye syndrome. Constantly focusing on screens for prolonged periods can cause eye discomfort, dryness, and fatigue. The blue light emitted by screens can disrupt the natural balance of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep patterns. This can result in sleep disturbances, further impacting overall physical health.
The Link between Screen Time and Decreased Productivity
Extended screen time can have a negative impact on productivity levels. Procrastination often accompanies excessive screen time, as individuals find themselves easily distracted by social media, entertainment, or other online activities. This can hinder their ability to complete tasks or meet deadlines, ultimately lowering overall productivity.
Moreover, excessive screen time can diminish the ability to concentrate and retain information. The constant exposure to various forms of media can overload the brain, making it difficult for individuals to focus on a single task for an extended period. This can lead to decreased attention, decreased productivity, and reduced information retention.
Addiction and Withdrawal Symptoms Related to Screen Time
Excessive screen time can lead to internet addiction disorder, characterized by an uncontrollable urge to be in front of screens, inability to control usage, and withdrawal symptoms when not engaged in screen-related activities. Internet addiction can significantly impact mental health, leading to social withdrawal, academic and occupational impairment, and increased feelings of anxiety and depression.
Withdrawal symptoms can occur when individuals attempt to reduce or stop screen time. These symptoms may include irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and intense cravings for screen-related activities. These symptoms can further reinforce the addictive cycle and make it challenging to break free from excessive screen time.
Screen Time and Relationships
Excessive screen time can have negative effects on relationships, both in romantic partnerships and friendships. One common consequence is an increase in conflict and reduced communication. Spending excessive time on screens can lead to neglect of real-life interactions and less time spent on meaningful conversations. This can result in feelings of resentment and decreased intimacy within relationships.
Moreover, excessive screen time can lead to decreased intimacy and emotional connection. The constant distraction provided by screens can create a barrier between individuals, hindering their ability to truly connect on an emotional level. This lack of deep emotional connection can lead to feelings of loneliness and dissatisfaction within relationships.
Screen Time Guidelines and Recommendations
Recognizing the negative impacts of excessive screen time, various organizations have established guidelines and recommendations for individuals to follow. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting screen time for children and adolescents, discouraging screens in the bedroom, and promoting media-free zones and times for the entire family. It is advised to have open discussions with children about screen time and its potential effects on mental health.
Balancing screen time with other activities is essential. It is recommended to engage in a variety of offline activities such as exercise, outdoor play, hobbies, and face-to-face social interactions. Finding alternatives to screen-related entertainment can help reduce excessive screen time and promote overall well-being.
Establishing healthy habits is crucial in managing screen time. This includes setting clear limits and boundaries on screen usage, using parental controls to monitor and regulate screen time for children, and creating a technology-free environment during certain periods of the day. It is important to prioritize mental health and consciously incorporate activities that promote well-being into daily routines.
Strategies to Reduce Screen Time and Improve Mental Health
To reduce excessive screen time and improve mental health, several strategies can be implemented. Setting limits and boundaries on screen time usage is crucial. This can be achieved by allocating specific hours or periods in a day for screen-related activities, and consciously avoiding unnecessary screen time during other times.
Engaging in offline activities is an effective way to reduce screen time and promote mental well-being. Finding hobbies, pursuing creative outlets, exercising, and spending quality time with loved ones can provide alternative sources of fulfillment and enjoyment.
A digital detox can also be beneficial. Taking periodic breaks from screens, such as weekends or vacations, allows individuals to disconnect and recharge. Engaging in mindful technology use, where one consciously chooses when and how to engage with screens, can lead to a healthier and more balanced relationship with technology.
In conclusion, excessive screen time has numerous negative impacts on mental health. From increased risk of depression and anxiety to decreased cognitive development and productivity, it is crucial to be mindful of our screen usage. By establishing healthy habits, setting limits, and engaging in offline activities, we can reduce the negative effects of excessive screen time and improve our overall mental well-being.

f you’re experiencing this, first know that you are not alone.
According to a recent Harvard Graduate School of Education report, 36% of all Americans—including 61% of young adults—feel “serious loneliness.”
Dealing with loneliness isn't always easy, but there's much you can do to try to regain that sense of connection and belonging. There are effective ways you can cope with loneliness, and professional treatment is available if you're in need. 
Seven tips for navigating loneliness
Included below are seven tips for navigating feelings of loneliness, some of which may be more helpful for you than others. Consider which methods might be most useful to you as you try to move forward. 
1. Recognize that loneliness is common
Sometimes, just knowing that many others around the globe are experiencing the same feelings of loneliness can be helpful. As mentioned above, nearly 40% of Americans feel “serious loneliness” according to one study, and another study found that more than three in five Americans—around 60%—are lonely. 
It is possible to feel lonely even if you have a loved one, significant other, children, or lots of friends. If you are feeling lonely, remembering that there are millions of others feeling the same way may help to reduce the perception of isolation. 
2. Nurture existing relationships
Loneliness can make us pull away from our relationships, even when we desire them the most. By nurturing the relationships you already have, you may start to feel more connected and may develop deeper bonds that help you feel less alone. When the people you love or care about seem distant, it can be hard to take the first step towards strengthening those bonds. 
Here are some ideas for connecting again:
* Start with something small, like a text message or phone call. 
* Schedule time each day or week for calling or visiting a friend. 
* Create recurring weekly plans with a friend or loved one, like watching a favorite TV show together each week. 
* Invite someone over for dinner. 
* Start conversations with neighbors when you can.
* Use social media to reconnect with those with whom you've lost touch due to time or distance.
3. Practice positive self-talk
When we’re feeling lonely, it can be easy to get caught up in negative thought patterns about ourselves that make us feel even worse and even more alone. We might say things like, “no one wants to be around me,” or “I’m no fun to be around, anyways.” 
To combat this, try to incorporate more positive self-talk, to show yourself a bit more compassion and self-love. Make an effort towards catching these negative thoughts and replacing them with a positive message instead. Talking positively about yourself and your life can change how you view yourself and how you go about your day. The process of positive self-talk may take practice, but it can be a key piece of addressing loneliness. 
4. Try a new hobby
Boredom can add weight on top of loneliness, giving us time to ruminate and stew in negative feelings. If you're already dealing with feelings of loneliness or social isolation, sitting by yourself in boredom likely won’t help very much. Instead, try to find something you enjoy to occupy your time and give your mind something else which to focus. 
Hobbies that you do by yourself can be fun and beneficial, but it may be even better to attempt ones that get you out more and allow you to connect with others. For instance, if you love knitting and often do it by yourself, maybe you can find a club or group to knit with instead. Or, if you like to cook or paint, maybe you can try a cooking class or art class. 
5. Find volunteer opportunities
One way to combat loneliness is by putting yourself in places where you can meet new, like-minded people. But sometimes just going out into public places doesn't do the trick, especially for people with shyness or social anxiety. By volunteering, you're not only putting yourself in a place where you can meet people, but you'll also be focused on a task. This may help prevent feelings of awkwardness that might arise in more open-ended, unstructured situations. It can also give you something to look forward to if you're struggling with finding meaning in your life. 
Another benefit of volunteering is that you can choose a cause that interests you so that the people you meet are likely to connect with your interests. For example, if you love animals, you might consider volunteering at a local animal shelter. 
6. Recognize the effects so you can combat them
Loneliness can have a range of effects on an individual’s physical health and mental health. Studies show that loneliness and social isolation can increase blood pressure, weaken your immune system, and affect brain functioning. Loneliness can also disrupt your sleep and negatively impact your eating patterns and exercise levels. 
Finally, loneliness can also affect your mental health. Loneliness and social isolation are frequently associated with depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and more. Loneliness is also a common feeling among individuals with suicidal thoughts. If you are experiencing loneliness, it is not something to take lightly—it can have wide-ranging negative effects, so it is important to address it. 
7. Seek professional help
Navigating feelings of loneliness can be difficult, but you don’t have to do it alone: professional help is available. If you are experiencing feelings of loneliness and need support, you can speak with your doctor or a mental health professional for help. In some cases, a persistent feeling of loneliness could be tied to depression, in which case, your doctor may suggest a range of treatment options, such as therapy and/or medication. 
A therapist can help you explore the factors behind your feelings and find ways to cope and move forward. Other concerns surrounding your emotions can be addressed in treatment as well. For example, if you've recently lost someone in the family or a close friend, you may be experiencing both loneliness and grief. Having an experienced professional there to support you through the healing process can make all the difference.
How online therapy can help
Sometimes, you might feel lonely because of your location or because of a mental health condition. If you are in a relatively isolated area where you have few resources and treatment facilities, seeking professional help might seem impossible. Similarly, if you are experiencing depression, the prospect of going out and seeking help may feel very difficult. In situations like these, online therapy such as BetterHelp can be beneficial. Since counseling takes place through an online platform, you can connect with your therapist virtually from any place you feel comfortable and have an internet connection. 
Research has found online therapy to be an effective option for reducing feelings of loneliness. For instance, one such study found that internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy “can be an efficacious option for alleviating loneliness.” 
Feeling lonely is a common experience, and it’s essential to address it for your mental well-being. Here are some strategies to help you cope with loneliness:
1. Practice Self-Kindness:
o Be gentle with yourself. Avoid self-blame when feeling lonely. Take care of your well-being and consider activities like a walk in nature or a spa day to boost your mood1.
2. Capitalize on the Present Moment:
o Share positive moments with others immediately. Call or text a friend when you feel good about something. These small connections can help combat loneliness1.
3. Connect in Real Life:
o Prioritize in-person interactions. Look people in the eyes, listen actively, and avoid distractions from technology. Strengthening these connections reduces loneliness1.
4. Rethink Your Spare Time:
o Instead of retreating alone, use loneliness as motivation to reach out to people. Seek social support and create meaningful moments with those who matter to you1.
Remember, it’s okay to feel lonely sometimes, but taking proactive steps can make a difference. If needed, consider talking to a mental health professional

What Is Loneliness? 4 Symptoms
Loneliness can be defined as a feeling of uneasiness or discomfort from either being alone or perceiving oneself to be alone (Rubenstein & Shaver, 1982). It is associated with perceived social isolation, rather than objective isolation.
Symptoms of loneliness range from psychological to physical. Adjectives such as boredom, self-pity, sadness, empty, and ashamed have been used to describe the feeling of loneliness.
Rubenstein and Shaver (1982) have categorized behavioral symptoms of loneliness into four areas:
1. Sad passivity, which includes crying, sleeping, doing nothing, overeating, taking tranquilizers, and excessive drinking and drug use
2. Active solitude activities, which involve writing, listening to music, exercising, working on a hobby, studying, and working to avoid loneliness
3. Spending money through excessive shopping or buying unnecessary items
4. Social contact by reaching out to friends, engaging in social activities, and doing things to avoid being alone
Psychology of Loneliness: Theories and Research
Researchers have categorized loneliness into chronic and transient loneliness (Choi et al., 2012).
Chronic loneliness is a persistent, internal experience that often extends over a period of many years, regardless of the situation. Chronic loneliness may vary in intensity over time (Choi et al., 2012).
Transient loneliness is experienced for shorter periods of time and is usually the result of a particular situation or environmental factor (Choi et al., 2012).
From a psychological perspective, loneliness includes affective, cognitive, and subjective components. These components can be represented by the psychodynamic, cognitive, and existential approaches in psychology.
The psychodynamic approach to loneliness was first described by Fromm-Reichmann (1959), who based loneliness on early childhood experiences arising from a separation between parent and child and a lack of physical contact and loving intimacy.
Similarly, John Bowlby argued that the mechanisms of loneliness were a response pattern for survival of the species and that the bond between mother and infant is based on biological needs (Hojat, 1989).
According to the cognitive approach, loneliness results from thought processes. Loneliness results when an individual’s perception and evaluation of social networks are not congruent (Heinrich & Cullone, 2006). Many of today’s definitions of loneliness are based on this subjective experience of connection and internal need for relationship.
The existential approach to loneliness is based on a phenomenological outlook, the feelings of loneliness, and the human condition with regard to others (Jones, 1989).
Existentialism is a philosophical approach and looks at loneliness as a starting point. This approach attempts to understand what that experience is like for the client rather than trying to treat the symptoms.
The effects of loneliness on the brain
Research has demonstrated significant effects of loneliness on the brain and cognitive function. Feeling socially isolated is a large predictor of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (Wilson et al., 2007).
Alzheimer’s disease has been predicted by the degree of loneliness, where those in the top decile of loneliness scores were 2.1 times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s than those in the bottom decile (Wilson et al., 2007).
Additionally, loneliness was inversely associated with performance on cognitive measures among 823 dementia-free older adults (Wilson et al., 2007). Loneliness was also associated with a faster decline in cognitive performance on a majority of cognitive measures over a four-year follow-up (Findlay, 2004).
Intelligence test results are also influenced by loneliness (Baumeister et al., 2005). In one study, researchers divided university students into three groups and provided false feedback after completing a personality profile and mood assessment.
Participants were told one of the following: that they had a personality profile indicating they would have rewarding relationships, that they would have a future alone, or that they were accident prone (Baumeister et al., 2005). Researchers concluded that the decline in cognitive ability was based solely on the idea or fear of being alone.
Similar research has shown that loneliness decreases cognitive performance skills and logical reasoning tasks. Baumeister et al. (2002) also found that telling individuals they would have a lonely future impaired self-restraint.

How Does It Affect Mental Health? 5 Effects
Loneliness is linked to a variety of mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, suicidal behavior, poor self-regulation, alcohol abuse, addiction, and eating disorders (Heinrick & Cullone, 2006).
Loneliness, depression, and grief
Loneliness and depression are both common emotions associated with grief, loss, and bereavement.
Research has found a greater intensity and frequency of loneliness among bereaved individuals, and it also plays a key role in levels of depression after someone has lost a partner (Vedder et al., 2021).
Symptoms of loneliness and depression are closely linked, and both are part of a normal grieving process.
Can loneliness cause anxiety?
There is a direct correlation between symptoms of loneliness and anxiety, particularly generalized anxiety disorder. However, the question of cause and effect is not clearly understood.
A longitudinal study of over 75,000 individuals found a direct association between both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic (Steen et al., 2022).
Feeling lonely can heighten anxiety since humans have a basic need for social connection, belonging, and protection from others.
4 Effects on physical health
1. Loneliness does not just affect an individual’s psychological and emotional health; its effects appear to accelerate physiological aging and predict morbidity and mortality (Shiovitz-Ezra & Ayalon, 2010).
Research shows that there is a correlation between loneliness scores and mortality. Additionally, the length of time spent feeling lonely (in years) influenced signs of physiological aging (Shiovitz-Ezra & Ayalon, 2010).
2. Loneliness also impacts cardiovascular health in both young and older adults. It has been linked to higher levels of HDL, cholesterol, hemoglobin concentration, maximum oxygen consumption, systolic blood pressure, and coronary heart disease (Thurston & Kubzansky, 2009).
3. Quality of sleep and daytime functioning can be affected by loneliness (Cacioppo et al., 2002). Sleep is important for restorative effects, and quality of sleep is important for physical and intellectual functioning, mental health, and engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors.
4. Immune function is associated with loneliness. Loneliness is related to poorer antibody responses to vaccines, impaired cellular immunity, and lower natural killer cell activity (Pressman et al., 2005).
4 Loneliness Tests, Scales, and Questionnaires
Knowing the prevalence and detrimental effects loneliness can have on the general population, it has become increasingly important to find methods of measurement and assessment.
Tests, scales, and questionnaires can provide education and training for healthcare workers and practitioners. The following scales have been used in both research and practice and create an effective base for creating interventions and treatment for loneliness.
1. The UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS)
The UCLA-LS is a well-established measure of loneliness that has been used in research studies for decades (Russell, 1996).
The scale is based on a subjective perception of loneliness where respondents rate items on a four-point scale from “never feeling this way” to “often feeling this way.”
While it is a valid and reliable measure of loneliness, it does not specifically address how long the participant has felt loneliness, so it does not distinguish between trait and state loneliness.
2. The De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJG-LS)
The DJG-LS has also demonstrated reliability and validity in research studies (de Jong Gierveld & van Tilburg, 1999).
The 11-item scale is scored based on statements that participants select. It assesses emotional and social loneliness with a broader scope of questions compared to the UCLA-LS.
3. Steptoe Social Isolation Index
Steptoe et al. (2013) created an index of social isolation. Social isolation can be an indication of loneliness. This index involves a five-point scale, with one point assigned for each of the following factors:
* Unmarried/not cohabiting
* Less than monthly contact (including face-to-face, by telephone, or in writing/email) with children
* Less than monthly contact (including face-to-face, by telephone, or in writing/email) with other family
* Less than monthly contact (including face-to-face, by telephone, or in writing/email) with friends
* No participation in social clubs, resident groups, religious groups, or committees
People with a score of 2 or more were defined as being socially isolated.
4. The Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS)
The LSNS is a short instrument designed to assess social isolation in older adults. It generally takes five to 10 minutes to complete and measures perceived social support from family and friends.
It has been used in research and in practical settings such as community hospitals, adult day care centers, assisted living facilities, and medical practices. The 10-item scale can guide caregivers as they monitor the needs of aging adults.
Permission to use the scale can be obtained through the Boston College School of Social Work.
How to Overcome Loneliness With Therapy
From a therapeutic approach, reducing feelings of loneliness involves fostering a sense of connectedness as well as modifying perceptions of social isolation.
Symptoms of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and emotional distress can be treated, but it is critical to address the root cause: cognitive biases, underlying concepts of social threat, hypervigilance, and individual need for social relationships.
Therapists, counselors, and support groups can help individuals identify the negative thinking patterns and core values that lead to loneliness. Additionally, therapy can provide resources to cope with loneliness, improve social connections and communication, and give a safe space for feelings of loneliness and other emotions.
Individuals can learn to move through grief, develop effective interpersonal skills, and build confidence to branch out and connect with others. Professionals can help clients overcome social anxiety, which is often an underlying cause of loneliness.
3 Interventions and Treatment Options
Interventions for loneliness can be categorized into three different approaches: individual treatments, group interventions, and environmental approaches (Choi et al., 2012).
1. Individual treatments
Individual treatments for loneliness include Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, psychodynamic therapies, and talk therapy to improve communication and solitary skills.
Therapists work with clients to identify anxious and avoidant thoughts and behaviors around social interactions to help them develop adaptive thought patterns and habits.
By learning appropriate coping skills, clients can interact and connect with others to develop healthy relationships.
2. Group interventions
Group interventions include group therapy to teach and practice social skills, communication, and emotional regulation in a group environment.
Groups can provide clients with immediate feedback in a safe environment and help normalize any social anxiety that may be the root cause of loneliness.
Group therapy may also include bereavement groups that allow individuals who are struggling with similar losses (causing loneliness) to connect.
3. Communities
Environmental treatment options explore interactions at the community level. They involve community awareness programs and restructuring social settings.
Things such as community events, block parties, game nights, and planned activities can help reduce social isolation.
Encouraging clients to get involved in volunteer activities and participate in community activities can create connections and help them develop relationships surrounding shared interests.
3 Counseling Worksheets and Activities
Worksheets and activities are wonderful ways to address loneliness in and out of therapy sessions. Providing individuals with tools allows them to take control of their own emotional wellbeing.
1. Three-Step Mindfulness
This Three-Step Mindfulness Worksheet helps lonely individuals shift their attention from the past or future (grief or anxiety about not having connection) to the present moment. By developing this internal awareness, clients can tolerate the waves of loneliness whenever they hit.
2. Self-Care Checkup
One of the best ways to overcome loneliness is to care for oneself. The Self-Care Checkup can guide individuals toward mental, physical, emotional, and social ways to care for themselves.
3. Emotional Wellness Worksheet
The National Institutes of Health provide wonderful Emotional Wellness worksheets that can address issues with and related to loneliness. From coping with loss to improving sleep and developing resilience through challenges, these tools can aid a variety of issues that cause loneliness.

Why am I depressed?
Feelings of sadness can quickly come and go, but when you’re depressed, these negative feelings stubbornly persist. Depression symptoms such as hopelessness, fatigue, lack of appetite, and decreased interest in school, work, or hobbies can arise for a variety of reasons. Your genetic makeup can make you more susceptible to depression, but stressful life events such as divorce, job loss, or past trauma often play a role. Substance abuse and loneliness can also contribute to feelings of depression.
If you’re feeling depressed, know that you’re far from alone. Research indicates that about 280 million people in the world suffer with depression. It can impact your work life, social life, and even your physical health. In severe cases, professional treatment may be necessary for recovery. But there are also a number of steps you can try for yourself to help boost your mood and improve how you feel.
What to do if you feel depressed tip 1: Talk to someone
The simple act of talking to someone who cares about you is crucial to dealing with feelings of depression. Know that reaching out is not a sign of weakness and won’t make you a burden. The person you talk to doesn’t have to be able to fix you; they just need to listen without being distracted or judging you.
Turn to people you trust. Talk to a close friend or family member about what you’re going through. Face-to-face interactions are best for boosting your mood, so schedule an in-person chat if possible.
Rely on technology when needed. When you feel sapped of energy, you might have a harder time being motivated to hang out with friends and family in-person. However, you may find it easier to stay in touch via video, phone, or text.
Prioritize giving and receiving support. Attending a support group for people with depression can offer an opportunity to draw comfort from others who are experiencing similar issues—and offer your own support in return. You’ll get to trade stories and receive coping advice from other people in the group who understand what you’re going through at the moment. If you feel uncomfortable with in-person support groups, some online therapy platforms offer virtual support groups.

Tip 2: Get moving
It’s probably the last thing you feel like doing right now—but getting active, even for a short period, is one of the most effective ways of boosting your mood. In fact, regular exercise can be just as effective as antidepressant medication in easing depression. And you don’t need to join an expensive gym or health club to reap the benefits.
* Take a short, 15-minute walk to boost your mood for several hours.
* Cycle, jog, or walk through a park or other green space.
* Dance to your favorite music.
* Play with your dog or kids.
* Try in-person or online exercise classes for aerobics, interval training, or Pilates.
* Create a simple home gym using resistance bands, water bottles, or your own body weight.
* Stretch or practice simple yoga poses.

Tip 3: Reframe negative thoughts
While external factors such as isolation, financial worries, or fears about your health can contribute to depression, so too can the way you think. But there are ways of looking at your situation in a more realistic, hopeful way.
1. Note when you have a negative thought such as “I’ll never be able to pay the mortgage and I’ll lose my home,” or “Everyone thinks I’m a loser.”
2. Challenge the thought by asking yourself “Do I know that for sure?” or “What would I say to a close friend who had the same thought?”
3. Change the thought to a more helpful way of thinking. “I can renegotiate mortgage payments with the bank” or “I’ve made it through bad times before. I can do it again.”
Tip 4: Find hope and contentment within
It’s natural to blame life circumstances for how you feel—especially in these difficult times. But there are ways to find contentment within, regardless of your situation.
Be your own friend. Instead of rehashing past mistakes, focusing on the negative aspects of your life, or dwelling on worst-case scenarios, talk to yourself in a kinder, more realistic way—the same way you’d expect a caring friend to talk to you.
Pat yourself on the back. Take a moment to acknowledge your role in the successes you’ve experienced in life and give yourself credit.
Change your morning thoughts. Before you go to sleep, write down something positive you can read as soon as you wake up in the morning—a hope you have for the day or something you’re grateful for.
Tip 5: Add mindfulness to your day
Mindfulness is the practice of focusing your attention on the present moment and accepting it without judgment. It can prevent you from getting caught up in worries about the future or regrets about the past.
Listen to a favorite song. Sit somewhere comfortable and give your attention fully to the music, even if it’s a song you’ve heard a thousand times before. Allow yourself to be present in the moment.
Try a mindful chore. Complete a household chore such as washing dishes while giving your attention fully to the task. Notice how things feel, smell, or sound and whenever your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the task.
Meditate. HelpGuide’s Mindful Breathing Meditation can help you harness the power of your breath to ground yourself in the present moment and find inner calm.
Tip 6: Express gratitude
When you’re depressed, everything in life can seem bleak and hopeless. But even on the darkest days, it’s usually possible to find one thing you can be grateful about—the beauty of a sunset, the feeling of the wind on your face, or a phone call from a friend, for example. Acknowledging gratitude for even the smallest things in life can give you a break from negative thinking and instill hope back into your day.
* Take a deep breath and think of one thing you’re grateful for: your children, your home, your pet, or even a smile from a stranger, for example.
* Before you switch off the light at night, take a moment to write down something that made you grateful today. Focus your mind on it as you fall asleep.
* Try HelpGuide’s Gratitude in Difficult Times meditation to help you find a more grateful mindset, even when you’re feeling down or despairing.
Tip 7: Savor simple sources of joy
You can’t just will yourself out of depression or force yourself to feel happier, but there are things you can do throughout the day to find joy, boost your mood, and ease stress.
* Listen to uplifting music, watch funny videos online, or download episodes of your favorite sitcom.
* Try to spend some time in nature—go for a walk in the park or find a new hiking trail.
* Help a friend or neighbor with an errand. Helping others can be just as beneficial to you as it is for them.
* Take a class either online or in-person, listen to a lecture, or take a tour of a museum.
* Take up a new hobby, learn to play an instrument, or write your memoirs—anything that brings you a sense of joy and fulfillment.
Tip 8: Get a daily dose of sunlight
When you’re feeling low, you might be tempted to close the blinds and self-isolate indoors. However, sunlight helps to boost serotonin levels and improve your outlook. Therefore, it’s important to try to expose yourself to sunlight for at least 15 minutes a day. This is especially important during winter, when the reduced daylight hours can take a serious toll on your mood.
* Take a walk at lunchtime, drink your morning coffee outside, or spend time outdoors exercising or doing yardwork.
* Increase the amount of natural light in your home by opening blinds and drapes and sitting near windows.
* Paint your walls in lighter colors or use daylight simulation bulbs.
* If you live somewhere with little winter sunshine, try using a light therapy box.
Tip 9: Don’t ignore thoughts of suicide
Depression is a major risk factor for suicide. If the deep despair and hopelessness that accompanies depression makes suicide feel like the only way to escape the pain, please reach out for help.
While your problems may seem overwhelming and permanent now, with time you will feel better, especially if you get help. There are many people who want to support you during this difficult time, so please reach out!

What helps people cope with depression?
If a person feels sustained, intense feelings of sadness or loss of interest in activities, they may have clinical depression. People also refer to this condition as major depressive disorder.
But there are small steps you can take to help you gain more agency in your life and improve your sense of well-being.
Read on to learn how to incorporate these strategies in a way that makes sense for you.

1. Meet yourself where you are
Depression affects millions of people, including some in your life. You may not realize they face similar challenges, emotions, and obstacles.
Being open, accepting, and loving toward yourself and what you’re going through may help you navigate depression.
Every day with this disorder is different. It’s important to take your mental health seriously and accept that where you are right now isn’t where you’ll always be.
2. Consider a walk around the block
On days when you feel you can’t get out of bed, exercise may seem like the last thing you’d want to do. But exercise and physical activity can help reduce symptoms of depression and improve energy levels.
ResearchTrusted Source suggests that, for some people, exercise can be as effective as medication at relieving depression symptoms. It may also help preventTrusted Source future depressive episodes.
Even when you feel you’re unable to or have little energy, see if you’d be willing to do the opposite of what your mood tells you to do. Instead, set a small goal for yourself, such as walking around the block.
3. Know that today isn’t indicative of tomorrow
Internal emotions and thoughts can change from day to day. Tracking experiences through journaling or keeping a mood diary can help you to remember this.
If you were unsuccessful at getting out of bed or accomplishing goals today, remember that you haven’t lost tomorrow’s opportunity to try again.
Give yourself the grace to accept that while some days will be difficult, others will also be less difficult. Try to look forward to tomorrow’s fresh start.
4. Assess the parts instead of generalizing the whole
Depression can tinge recollections with difficult emotions. You may find yourself focusing on things that are unhelpful or perceived as difficult.
Try to stop this overgeneralization. Push yourself to recognize the good. If it helps, write down what was meaningful about the event or day. You can track what you achieved that day and which activities were enjoyable.
Seeing the weight you’re giving to one thing may help you direct your thoughts away from the whole and to the individual pieces that were helpful.
5. Do the opposite of what the ‘depression voice’ suggests
The automatic, unhelpful voice in your head may talk you out of self-help. But if you learn to recognize this voice, you can learn to work through it.
If you believe an event won’t be fun or worth your time, say to yourself, “You might be right, but it’ll be better than just sitting here another night.” You may soon see that automatic thought isn’t always helpful.
6. Set attainable goals
Instead of compiling a long list of tasks, consider setting small goals. Setting and accomplishing these goals can provide a sense of control and accomplishment and help with motivation.
Attainable goals may include:
* Don’t clean the house; take the trash out.
* Don’t do all the laundry that’s piled up; sort the piles for later.
* Don’t clear out your entire email inbox; just address any time-sensitive messages.
When you’ve done a small thing, set your eyes on another small thing, and then another. This way, you have a list of tangible achievements and not an untouched to-do list.
7. Reward your efforts
All goals are worthy of recognition, and all successes are worthy of celebration. When you achieve a goal, do your best to recognize it.
You may not feel like celebrating with a cake and confetti, but recognizing your own successes can be a powerful tool for depression’s negative weight.
The memory of a job well done may be especially powerful against unhelpful self-talk and overgeneralization.
8. Create a routine
If depressive symptoms disrupt your daily routine, a gentle schedule may help you feel in control. These plans don’t have to map out an entire day.
Focus on creating a loose but structured routine to help you keep your daily pace.
9. Do something you enjoy
Depression can push you to give in to your fatigue. It may feel more powerful than preferred emotions.
Try to push back and do something you love — something that’s pleasurable or meaningful. It could be playing an instrument, painting, hiking, or biking.
Engaging in meaningful activities lifts your mood or energy, which can further motivate you to continue to engage in activities that help with navigating symptoms.
10. Listen to music
ResearchTrusted Source shows music can improve your mood and symptoms of depression. It may also strengthen your reception of positive emotions.
Music can be especially beneficial when performed in group settings, such as a musical ensemble or band.
You can also reap some of the same rewards simply by listening.
11. Spend time in nature
Time in nature can have a powerful influence on a person’s mood. ResearchTrusted Source suggests that walks in nature may improve depressive symptoms in people with clinical depression.
Time in natural spaces may improve mood and cognition and lower the risk of mental health disorders. But there’s only limited research on the direct effect of nature on those with clinical depression.
Consider taking a walk at lunch among the trees or spending time in your local park. Or plan a weekend hike. These activities can help you reconnect with nature and soak in some rays at the same time.
12. Spend time with loved ones
Depression can tempt you to isolate yourself and withdraw from people you love and trust, but face-to-face time can help wash away those tendencies.
If you’re unable to spend time together in person, phone calls or video chats can also be helpful.
Try to remind yourself these people care about you. Resist the temptation to feel like you’re a burden. You need the interaction — and they likely do too.
13. Express your feelings
Consider writing or journaling about what you’re experiencing. Then, when the feelings lift, write about that too. ResearchTrusted Source suggests that keeping a journal can be a beneficial add-on method for managing mental health conditions.
Writing down your thoughts can help you express what you’re feeling more clearly. It can also help you keep track of your symptoms daily and identify their causes.
You can make a goal to write for a few minutes each day or week. Most importantly, what you want to write about is completely up to you.
14. Try something new entirely
When you do the same thing day after day, you use the same parts of your brain.
Doing new things can feel rewarding and may improve your overall well-being and strengthen your social relationships.
To reap these benefits, consider trying a new sport, creative class, or cooking technique.
15. Try volunteering
You can knock out a few birds with one stone — spending time with other people and doing something new — by volunteering and giving your time to someone or something else.
You may be used to receiving help from friends, but reaching out and providing help may actually improve your mental health more.
Bonus: People who volunteer experience physical benefits too. This includes a lowered riskTrusted Source of hypertension and improved sleep.
16. Practice gratitude
When you do something you love, or even when you find a new activity you enjoy, you may be able to benefit your mental health more by taking time to be thankful for it.
Practicing gratitude can have lasting positive effectsTrusted Source on your overall mental health.
What’s more, writing down your gratitude — including in notes to others — can be particularly meaningful.
17. Incorporate meditation
Stress and anxiety can prolong your depression symptoms. Finding relaxation techniques can help you lower stress and invite more joy and balance into your day.
ResearchTrusted Source suggests that mindfulness activities may help you improve your sense of well-being and feel more connected to what’s happening around you. These activities can include:
* meditation
* yoga
* deep breathing
* journaling
18. Eat well
There’s no magic diet that will treat depression. But what you put into your body can have a real and significant effect on the way you feel.
Some people also feel better and have more energy when they avoid sugar, preservatives, and processed foods.
If you have the means, consider meeting with a doctor or registered dietitian for guidance.
Eating a diet rich in lean meats, vegetables, and grains may be a great place to start. Try to limit stimulants such as caffeineTrusted Source, coffee, and soda and depressants such as alcoholTrusted Source.
19. Consider limiting drugs and alcohol
Substances such as drugsTrusted Source or alcoholTrusted Source can contribute to perpetuating feelings of sadness.
On the other hand, people who live with addiction may experience symptoms of depressionTrusted Source.
You may want to consider limiting or avoiding the use of alcohol and other substances to help your depressive symptoms.
20. Practice sleep hygiene
Sleep disturbancesTrusted Source are common with depression. You may not sleep well, or you may sleep too much. Both can make depression symptoms worse.
Aim for 8 hours of sleep per night. Try to get into a healthy sleeping routine.
Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day can help you with your daily schedule. Getting the proper amount of sleep may also help you feel more balanced and energized throughout your day.
21. Accept the validity of your emotions
Suppressing and compartmentalizing your feelings may seem like a strategic way to cope with the difficult symptoms of depression. But this technique is ultimately unhealthyTrusted Source and ineffective.
If you’re having a down day, acknowledge it. Notice and name your emotions and try to bring your attention to engaging in activities that are helpful instead of focusing on the emotions.
Seeing the ebb and flow of depressive symptoms can be instructive for both self-healing and hope.
22. Consider treatment
You may also find it helpful to speak with a professional about what you’re going through. A general practitioner may be able to refer you to a therapist or other specialist.
They can assess your symptoms and help develop a clinical treatment plan tailored to your needs. This may include various options, such as medication and therapy.
Finding the right treatment for you may take some time, so be open with a doctor or healthcare professional about what is and isn’t working. They’ll work with you to find the best option.
Depression is more complicated than most people think. It’s not just about being sad and it certainly isn’t about being lazy. But those are common misconceptions that sometimes prevent people from seeking treatment and getting the help they need to feel better.
Even when you’re experiencing depression, it can be tough to identify how you’re feeling and it can be hard to take steps to improve your mood and outlook in the moment.
That’s why we put together this article—to help you on your journey in coping with your symptoms. A better understanding of how you’re feeling and what action you can take can empower you to live your best life even when you’re feeling depressed.
Learn How Depression Affects You
Some people experience more irritability than sadness when they're depressed, other people report feelings of guilt and hopelessness. And while some people report their emotions stay pretty constant, other people say their depression causes their emotions to shift pretty quickly.
Before you can make decisions about how to best cope with depression or what types of treatments you want to try, it’s essential to gain a better understanding of the emotions you’re experiencing.
Then, you can develop a plan for dealing with each of those emotions you're encountering. What works to calm you down when you’re feeling anxious might not be helpful when you’re feeling unappreciated.
Practice Identifying Emotions
Research has also shown that depression can affect how people interpret emotions. One study found that depressed people were less able to accurately recognize happiness, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise.1 Another study found that depressed people are good at recognizing sad facial expressions, but struggle with other emotions, including happiness and surprise.2
Some strategies that can help you better identify what you are feeling include the following:
* Keep a journal: Write down what you are experiencing and feeling in an emotional journal. As you write, you may find it easier to recognize your feelings. This can also help you spot patterns in your emotional responses.
* Track a single emotion: It can also be helpful to track a single emotion over time. Start noticing when you feel something, whether it's sadness, joy, or gratitude. With practice, you can better identify the feeling and what is causing it.
* Expand your emotional vocabulary: Recognize that emotional responses can be complex and mixed. Finding new ways to talk about emotions can add greater depth and understanding. Rather than just describing yourself as "sad," you might characterize what you feel as glum, dejected, regretful, downhearted, or sorrowful.
Identifying these emotional components you're encountering can help you develop strategies to feel better sooner. And while everyone's experience with depressive symptoms is a little different, developing a better understanding of the emotions you're encountering can help you determine which coping skills work best for you.
Explore Ways to Cope
In addition to identifying your emotions, it is important to start taking steps toward changing those feelings. Treatments for depression are typically multi-faceted and can include medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes. Some self-help strategies that can improve your ability to cope include:
* Creating a daily routine: Sticking to a consistent routine can be helpful when you are dealing with stress and depression.3 Having structure in your day also makes it easier to stick to healthy habits that can combat feelings of depression.
* Giving yourself things to look forward to: Research has shown that anticipating positive future events can positively affect well-being.4 It is essential to find things to look forward to, no matter how small.
* Getting regular exercise: Exercise can be helpful in both the prevention and treatment of depression. One study found that low, moderate, and high-intensity exercise effectively treated mild to moderate depression.5
* Setting limits on social media/technology use: Spending too much time glued to your smartphone or tablet can also harm mental health, particularly when that time is spent scrolling through social media. In one study, social media users experienced a 70% increase in self-reported symptoms of depression.6
* Spending time with others: While depression may cause you to want to withdraw from your loved ones, research has shown that decreased social support has a negative effect on depression symptoms.7 If you've withdrawn or isolated yourself, start taking steps to reach out to trusted friends and family members.
* Enjoying the outdoors: Evidence has shown that spending less time outdoors is linked to worse well-being and increased symptoms of depression and anxiety.8 You can combat this by making a conscious effort to spend a little time outside each day. Something as simple as walking around your neighborhood can help increase your outdoor time and improve your emotional well-being.
Take Small Steps
Your depression will try to convince you that nothing will work to help you feel better. It’ll tell you there’s no use in trying any formal treatment, and any steps you take to improve your emotional state will be useless.
It may tell you there's no sense in taking medication because it won't work. Or, your depression might try to convince you that you shouldn't talk to a therapist because talking won't help. Consequently, you might not take any action that could help you feel better.
That’s what depression does to your brain—it makes you think unrealistically negative thoughts.
Try New Strategies
But, the truth is, you won’t know if various strategies work until you try them. You don’t have any take huge leaps to help yourself feel better (that’s likely to feel overwhelming when you’re depressed). Instead, you can try small steps to see if specific strategies help you feel better.
How to Combat Defeating Thoughts
A great mantra to create for yourself: “Let’s try.” Even as your depression tries to talk you out of doing something, remind yourself, you won’t know if it could help until you at least give it a try.
To do so, however, you'll have to go against what your brain is telling you. For example, depression might try to convince you to just stay in bed all day. But staying in bed is likely to keep you stuck in a depressed mood.
Push Yourself
You might have to push yourself to get up, get dressed, go for a walk, or call a friend. While you might think none of things will help you feel better (or you might even think they'll make you feel worse), getting active might decrease your symptoms a little if you're willing to try.
Find What Works for You
Think of various coping strategies as experiments. Some of them may help you feel better and others might not necessarily work for you. But the more experiments you try, the better equipped you'll be in identifying which strategies best reduce your symptoms.
A Word From Verywell
While it’s important to have professionals who are helping you manage your depression, like a physician and a therapist, there are also many strategies you can try at home to alleviate your symptoms.

Turning aspirations into achievements can seem challenging, but achieving your personal goals doesn’t have to be overwhelming or unreachable. It’s all about breaking them down into manageable steps.
Whether your goals relate to your career, health, or personal fulfillment, establishing clear, attainable objectives can help you achieve your dreams.



Why do we set personal goals?
It might seem like a silly question to ask but understanding the reason we set personal goals can help us create more meaningful goals.
These are important because they stop us from wandering through life without clear direction, and support us on the journey toward personal growth. 
When you set personal goals, they’ll reflect what you genuinely wish to achieve.. Embracing goals can motivate you, shape your decisions, and bring a sense of purpose. They're not just about where you want to go but they can also define who you want to become along the way.
Setting meaningful goals may not be second nature, but sometimes they are born out of daydreaming. So, the next time you find yourself daydreaming about the future, write those aspirations down or record a voice note for yourself. Those daydreams might become the goals that lead you to a fulfilling journey of self-discovery.
Not all personal goals created equal
Not all goals will look alike and not all goals need to be long-lasting. Depending on what your needs are, you can set short-term goals, mid-term goals, or long-term goals.
Short-term goals: These goals are achieved relatively quickly, perhaps within a few weeks to a year. Short term goals should be goals that are time-sensitive, or that are easy to achieve.
Mid-term goals: These goals might take anywhere from one to three years to accomplish. Perhaps you’re saving for a special vacation or getting an advanced degree. 
Long-term goals: These goals typically take three or more years to achieve. These might include, buying a house, achieving a career milestone, or even preparing for retirement. These goals may require time, planning, and perseverance.



5 types of personal goals you can set
Whether you're into upping your skills, sorting your finances, or building relationships, you can build goals around every aspect of your life. With so many avenues to explore, it can be hard to know where to begin. Start by thinking about the five key areas of your life.
Family and social goals
This category revolves around strengthening familial, friendship, and community ties. Whether it's increasing quality time with your kids or planning a girls’ night, these goals help you build and strengthen your social circle.
Create or participate in community: Feeling a part of a community is great for self-esteem, and overall mental health. For some people this might look like joining a community garden, belonging to a local library, visiting a farmer’s market, visiting a local park, or spending time with people nearby who you care about. If you are eager to meet people in your community, you might make it a goal to look into local events in your area. 
Give back to your community or a cause you care about: Sometimes giving back to your community can feel really good. If time is limited, even making a donation to a worthy cause that you feel passionately about can be a worthwhile goal.
Financial goals
Financial goals are about smart money management. Whether you’re dreaming of traveling the world or planning a comfortable retirement, it’s important to set goals around how you want to use your money. Setting aside a specific amount of money monthly, understanding how to invest, or becoming more financially savvy are good objectives as well. 
Pay down existing debts (in ways that work for you): Strategizing and working toward living debt-free can be really empowering, but paying off debts can also be very stressful. Find ways to plan for this mindfully so that you can keep your mental health and overall wellbeing intact as you work towards your goals. 
Start a business or project that you’re passionate about: There’s no requirement to monetize your hobbies as they are meant to be enjoyed. With that said, sometimes there’s an activity you love that you’d love to turn into your work. Other times having new projects to pursue gives even more enjoyment and purpose to your day to day life. Setting these kinds of goals can be both empowering and exciting.
Set up a monthly savings plan: Saving regularly for future goals like achieving financial freedom, buying a house, or going on vacation can be really fun and rewarding. Start small, setting aside what you can each month and then enjoy watching it grow. 
Personal development goals
From learning a new language to joining a pottery class, personal development goals feed your soul and expand your horizons.
Read for pleasure and curiosity: If you’ve been hoping to read more, make it a goal to pick up a new book. You can even choose a variety of genres to broaden your perspectives. If reading is tough, audiobooks can be a wonderful alternative.
Learn something you’ve always been curious about: Lifelong learning can be a fulfilling pursuit. If there’s something new you’re excited to learn, or curious about, enroll in that class or workshop. 
Keep a journal: Document your thoughts, experiences, and self-discoveries regularly. Writing down how you feel day-to-day can also help you process tough feelings or experiences. Check out our journal prompts for anxiety.
Master a skill: Learning something new can be really exciting and empowering. It might be picking up an instrument you’ve always wanted to try, learning to cook, crafting, taking up woodshop, gardening, or maybe creating a photo album or scrapbook. 
Plan a trip: Explore new cultures and create lifelong memories by traveling. Even budget travel and local travel can be enriching. If leaving your town or city isn’t an option, try exploring places, shops or restaurants in your town that you’ve never been to before.
Practice mindfulness: Use tools and techniques to help you live in the moment. Mindfulness tools like meditation, grounding techniques and breath work practices can be great goals to add to your day-to-day routine. 



Career goals
Career goals propel you forward professionally. So if you’re interested in climbing the corporate ladder or paving your entrepreneurial path, setting actionable steps can help get you there. 
Network intentionally: If you’re looking to try something new for work, or move to a new job, try networking more. Attend events to meet professionals and explore collaborative opportunities. 
Explore options for a promotion: Aiming for advancement in your current role through dedication and strategic planning can be empowering. And there’s nothing wrong with asking if there are other opportunities available to you at your current job.
Enhance your professional skills: Good workplace morale is all about offering value and feeling valued by your employers. If you want to uplevel yourself at work, identify and develop new, essential skills in your field.
Seek a mentor or coach: Find an experienced individual in your chosen career for guidance and advice. If finding a coach is out of your means, consider reaching out to those you respect or admire and ask whether they'd be willing to act as a mentor
Health and wellbeing goals
Health goals can be as bold as running a marathon or climbing a mountain or as simple as a daily walk or weekly yoga practice. It’s about ensuring your physical and mental wellbeing are in harmony.
Start a regular movement practice: Movement is great for physical and mental health alike. While not everyone has the flexibility or time to run a marathon, there are many ways to incorporate movement into your day to day. Other options for movement might include enrolling in a dance class, practicing yoga, taking up qigong or tai chi, or even going for walks in your immediate area. 
Grow your own vegetables: It can be a great goal to grow your own food at home if you have the means to do so. Cultivating a garden with fresh, home-grown produce can be a great way to try new veggies, or incorporate more of them to your diet. If you don’t have outdoor space, even growing herbs on a windowsill at home can be a worthy goal.
Set limits around screen time: Allocate specific times to unplug and experience life without digital distractions. Especially before bedtime, it’s important to unplug.
Work on your habits: The daily habits and rituals that make up your day can amount to significant changes in your life. If there are areas where you want to change, set small attainable goals.

How to set (and achieve) personal goals in 8 steps
It’s important to set goals that are clear, meaningful, and, most importantly, achievable. Here are some ways you can start. 
1. Brainstorm your personal goals
When it comes to setting goals for yourself, start by being open-minded. Jot down all the goals that come to mind. Dream big—this is the time to lay all your cards on the table.
Sift through the list to pin down goals that truly reflect your desires. Understanding your why will add a layer of meaning and drive you forward even when things get tough.
2. Visualize the future 
Take a moment to close your eyes and picture your life after achieving your goals. How does it look? How do you feel? This visualization can serve as a powerful motivator. 
Ask yourself why you want to achieve each goal. Be honest with yourself. It’s tempting to set goals based on what society expects or what looks good on paper. But genuine, lasting motivation stems from goals that echo your authentic desires.
3. Break down your personal goals
Break each goal down into manageable bite-sized chunks. For example, if you want to write a novel, start by committing to 500 words a day. Learning a musical instrument? Dedicate 20 minutes to practice every day. 
Small but powerful tasks help you focus on what’s important and make the journey less intimidating. Setting SMART goals will help move you forward and keep you accountable.
SMART goals
Specific: Your goal should be clear and well-defined. Instead of saying, "I want to be healthier," refine it to "I want to exercise 30 minutes a day."
Measurable: How will you know when you’ve achieved your goal? By setting benchmarks. Maybe it’s losing 10 pounds, reading 20 books, or saving $5,000.
Achievable: Be realistic—your goals should stretch your abilities but remain possible. If you’ve never run before, aiming for a 5K might be more realistic than a full marathon... at least to start!
Relevant: Your goal should align with your broader life objectives. If you're aiming to be more present in life, a goal to practice mindfulness each day might be helpful.
Time-bound: Attach a deadline. Whether it's three months to declutter your home or one year to learn a new language, having an end date creates urgency.



4. Make a list of your personal goals
Write your goals down and put them somewhere you’ll see them every day. This solidifies your intentions, making them tangible. Plus, you’ll get a huge sense of achievement in ticking goals off as you accomplish them!
5. Set deadlines for your personal goals and schedule them
Allocate a specific timeframe to each task. Make sure to give yourself enough time to complete them. Deadlines also create a sense of urgency and help keep procrastination at bay. Read our flow state article for tips on making the most of your time.
6. Celebrate small wins
Every step forward is progress. Celebrate small victories along the way—it’ll boost your morale and motivate you. The more you’re able to celebrate your achievements the more you’ll demonstrate for yourself that you can do more and more. It’s a win-win.
7. Seek support
Don’t hesitate to ask for help or guidance if you feel lost or stuck. Whether it’s friends, family, or mentors, having a support network can make a significant difference. If the idea of setting goals feels overwhelming, take a step back and start small. 
8. Regularly review and adjust your personal goals
Life is unpredictable so regularly review your goals and adjust them as needed. Staying flexible allows you to navigate through unexpected challenges while staying on course.
Remember, the journey to achieving your goals is as important as reaching them. It’s about growing, learning, and evolving. 
Personal Goals FAQs
What are the 3 types of personal goals?
You can set many types of personal goals, but—broadly speaking—there are three different categories:
Short-term goals: These can be achieved relatively quickly, perhaps within a few weeks to a year. Maybe it's reading a particular book or enrolling in a course.
Mid-term goals: These usually take anywhere from one to three years to accomplish. Perhaps saving for a special vacation or attaining a particular certification. 
Long-term goals: These are goals that typically take 3 or more years to achieve. Buying a house, achieving a career milestone, or preparing for retirement are all in this camp. They require time, planning, and perseverance.
How do you write a personal goal?
Envision the things you really want from life, then set SMART targets:
* Specific: Clearly define what you want. Instead of "I want to get fit," try "I want to run a 5K in six months."
* Measurable: Add some numbers or markers to track your progress. "Lose 10 pounds" or "read 5 books."
* Achievable: Ensure it's realistic. If you're new to a skill, start small and build up.
* Relevant: Your goal should align with your broader life objectives. Does it get you closer to where you want to be?
* Time-bound: Add a deadline. "Save $1000 in 12 months" gives you a clear timeline.
With these ingredients, you've got goals that are ready to be achieved.
What is a personal goal, and why set one?
They're markers we set for ourselves to achieve something we desire. It might be climbing a career ladder, mastering French cooking, or cultivating a more positive mindset. The "why" is your drive and motivation. Having personal goals gives you direction, challenging you to grow into the life you envision.
Are personal goals important?
Personal goals are essential. They can help:
* Provide direction: Giving your life a sense of purpose and direction.
* Boost motivation: Fuelling your drive and enthusiasm.
* Enhance self-confidence: Achieving goals boosts self-belief.
* Enable growth: Leaving your comfort zone leads to personal development.
Personal goals lead us to our best selves—it's a journey worth embarking on.
Certainly! Setting and achieving personal goals can significantly impact your mental and emotional well-being. Here are some steps to guide you:
1. Identify What You Want to Change: Start by pinpointing the specific aspect of your mental health that you want to work on. Whether it’s managing anxiety, improving mood, or building stronger relationships, clarity is essential.
2. Set SMART Goals:
o Specific: Define your goal precisely. For example, instead of saying, “I want to reduce stress,” specify, “I will practice deep breathing exercises for 10 minutes daily.”
o Measurable: Make your goal quantifiable. How will you measure progress? For instance, “I’ll track my daily meditation sessions.”
o Attainable: Ensure your goal is realistic and achievable. Set yourself up for success.
o Relevant: Align your goal with your overall well-being. Consider how it fits into your life.
o Time-bound: Set a deadline. For example, “I’ll complete a mindfulness course within the next month.”
3. Practice Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself during this process. Progress matters more than perfection.
4. Monitor Progress: Regularly assess how you’re doing. Adjust your approach if needed.
5. Celebrate Small Wins: Acknowledge and celebrate each milestone. It boosts confidence and motivation.


The word ‘goals’ is thrown around a lot these days. So much so that it can be confusing to pin down what a goal really is.
Are resolutions and objectives the same as goals?
Why do we need to set goals?
Research by a psychologist and career coach at Dominican University of California shows that there’s a direct correlation between setting goals and achieving success. Properly defined goals help trigger new behaviors and help you focus on what’s important to you.
Of course, it’s not just about setting goals. It’s also about achieving them.
Let’s look at the top strategies for how to set goals and achieve them in both your personal and professional life.
Goals: what are they, and what aren’t they?
Before setting goals, you need to know what a goal is.
A goal is something you want to achieve. It’s the desired result that you, or a group of people, plan and commit to achieving.
Put simply, a goal is a dream with a deadline.
Still a bit confused? Here are some characteristics of what goals are and what they aren’t.
A goal is:
* Your vision for the future. Goals should be the result of careful consideration of a personal vision statement and the things you want to achieve.
* Time-sensitive. The most effective goals are time-bound. Goals generally have a longer time frame. They can then be broken down into smaller, short-term objectives.
* Large in nature. Don’t be afraid to set a big goal that seems like a reach. Feel free to think outside the box and dream big. You can set smaller, short-term goals to help you get there.
A goal is not:
* An objective. While goals describe what you want to achieve, objectives are the steps taken to reach the goal. For example, “I want to become a confident public speaker” is a goal. “I will work with a coach to practice my public speaking skills by the end of this month” is the objective.
* A resolution. Resolutions are often temporary, giving short-term gratification (as opposed to delayed gratification). While a resolution is a decision to do or not do something, a goal is what you want to achieve.
* A mission. Mission statements create a clear and focused direction to follow. It’s the statement of purpose from which a company, business, or individual operates. On the other hand, a goal is a specific aim you or your team work toward.


7 common types of goals
There are various types of goals that people can set for themselves. Here are some of the most common types of goals:
1. Short-term goals: These are goals that can be achieved relatively quickly, typically within a few days, weeks, or months. So they can be broken down further into yearly goals, monthly goals, weekly goals, and daily goals.
2. Long-term goals: These are goals that require a more extended period to accomplish, usually spanning several months or years.
3. Personal goals: These are goals that relate to an individual's personal life, such as health, relationships, and hobbies.
4. Professional goals: These are goals that relate to an individual's career, such as job performance, promotions, and skill development.
5. Financial goals: These are goals related to an individual's finances, such as saving for a down payment on a house, paying off debt, or investing for retirement.
6. Academic goals: These are goals related to an individual's education, such as obtaining a degree, improving grades, or learning a new skill.
7. Social goals: These are goals that relate to an individual's social life, such as making new friends, improving communication skills, or attending social events.
It's important to identify the types of goals that align with your values and priorities to make goal-setting more effective and meaningfultly.

What is goal setting?
Goal-setting is the process of identifying something you want to accomplish and establishing measurable and specific objectives to achieve it. Goals are your desired results that you or your team are committed to achieving within a specific time frame. It involves setting long-term and short-term objectives that help you stay focused on your goals, track your progress, and attain the desired result.
Why is goal-setting important?
Goal-setting is important because it provides direction and purpose in life. When you set goals, you identify what you want to achieve and what you need to do to achieve it. It motivates you to take action, whether it’s in your personal or professional life, and gives you a sense of control over your future.
Goals also help you to see the bigger picture and provide you with a sense of accomplishment once you achieve them.
Here are some of the many reasons why setting realistic goals for yourself and your team is important.
It gives a sense of direction
Taking the time to think about what you want in life gives you a sense of purpose.
For example, you could create a five-year plan based on what you want your life to look like in five years. Having this long-term plan can help you move from just dreaming to actually doing.
In the workplace, setting goals helps to set a clear path to where you want your team to go. It also helps to set expectations for different team members.  
It helps to see the bigger picture
Setting goals helps us take a step back and get some perspective on what’s really important. It’s the first step toward creating a life full of meaning.
At work, setting goals as a team helps everyone get the whole picture. Knowing the long-term goal and what a company is striving toward can help each team member perform better in their role.
It provides motivation
By nature, consciously setting goals gives you something to aspire to. Having a specific goal will motivate you (and your team) to put your best foot forward.
As a team member, having a clear vision of what your team is aiming to achieve provides inspiration and motivation. Working with your team to move toward a common goal is motivating and satisfying, giving your team purpose.
It gives you greater control of your future
Setting goals puts you in the driver’s seat of your life. Just by writing down goals, you are actively acknowledging what you want out of life.
It’s the first step toward taking control of your future.

What is goal-setting theory?
Goal-setting theory is a motivational theory that explains how goals affect behavior. It suggests that setting specific, challenging goals leads to increased performance, persistence, and motivation.
The theory states that setting goals gives individuals a clear understanding of what is expected of them and helps them to focus on the most important tasks. Furthermore, it indicates that individuals who set specific and challenging goals are more likely to achieve better results than those who set vague or easy goals.
The theory suggests that feedback and commitment are essential elements in goal setting and achievement. So ensuring you are not setting and going after your goals in a vacuum will help you to be more successful in achieving them.
How to set achievable goals at work and in life 
Now that you know how beneficial goals are, it’s time to dive into how to set goals and achieve them.
Whether you’re setting group goals for your team or personal goals, it’s important to start with goals that are big enough but still realistic.
Here are tips for setting both personal and team goals:
Personal goal-setting tips
Let’s take a look at three tips for setting personal goals.
1. Consider your passions
Part of the process for how to set life goals should be deciding what inspires you and what your values are. You should be passionate about your goals if you want to achieve them in the long run.
Your goals should be meaningful to you and provide you with a sense of pride once you meet them.
2. Set goals you can control
If your goal is based on something outside of your control, you won’t be able to control whether or not you actually achieve it.
Your personal goals shouldn’t be dependent on other people. They also shouldn’t be reliant on external factors that you have no control over.
Be realistic about what you can and can’t be directly responsible for.
3. Imagine your future
Take some time to really think about what you’d like your life to look like. What does your ideal future entail?
For example, if you’re setting personal career goals, ask yourself some questions that will point you in the right direction.
How much money do you ideally want to earn? Do you want to work for yourself? How many hours do you want to commit to on a daily basis?
Even if these questions don’t immediately help you pick a single job, they will certainly make you realize what you don’t want your career goals to be.
Tips for setting goals at work 
Let’s take a look at three tips for setting team goals:
1. Brainstorm
Before you write down the first goal that comes to mind, take time to brainstorm as a team. Asking big questions like “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” will get the creative juices flowing.
2. Include everyone
It’s important that everyone is heard during the goal-setting process. Each member of your team should feel they can speak openly and contribute their ideas for goals.
Having everyone’s input will help create goals that everyone is invested in.
Write down each team member’s ideas, no matter how silly, so that they feel heard. Together, you can go through each goal to decide if it works for the whole team.
3. Ask why
It’s important to discuss the purpose of your group goal so that everyone is on the same page. During your goal-setting session, create a relaxed atmosphere that encourages questions from everyone if there is any uncertainty.
What are we doing? Where do we want to be? What does success look like?
Every team member should have a shared vision for why you have set this common goal. It will give your team clarity on what you want to achieve and make it easier for everyone to work together.

10 tips to achieve your goals 
Setting goals is just the beginning. After taking the time to identify what your goals are, achieving them is a whole other ball game.
Working to achieve your goals can feel overwhelming at times. Here are some effective goal-setting tips on how to achieve life goals to the best of your ability.
1. Have SMART goals
You’re not going to achieve your goals if they aren’t SMART. If you haven’t heard of SMART goals already, they are goals that are:
* Specific. There’s no point in setting vague goals that don’t achieve anything specific.

Research by the creators of goal setting theory, Locke & Latham, found that in 90% of studies conducted, specific and challenging goals lead to higher performance than when people were set either easy goals, “do your best” goals, or no goals at all.

It’s important for both you and your employees to have clear and established aims, to avoid potentially setting goals so broad that they are overwhelming and therefore too difficult to set into action.
* Measurable. Once you have a specific goal pinned down, it’s important to be able to measure the success or completion of the goal.

This doesn’t have to be in the traditional sense, like on a numeric scale or a statistic, it just has to be measurable in some sense, so that it is clear when you have reached or are close to reaching your goal.
* Attainable. A SMART goal must be within reach. Lean on data, analytics, and research to help set attainable goals. 
* Relevant. It is essential that any goals set for teams or individuals are relevant to company-wide aims.

Of course, goal completion is important, and having goals met or worked towards is the overall idea when setting them, but this is only really beneficial when the goals are productive in the workplace environment and will contribute to company success in some way.

As a manager, it is particularly important that you help your employees link their goals back to the wider team and company-wide goals. One of the best ways to motivate your employees is to make sure they know how their work is contributing to the bigger picture.
* Time-bound. Goals must be time-related. It’s not productive to set a deadline too far in the future for a simple task, or an unrealistically short deadline for something complex and time-consuming.

This common pitfall can be incredibly demotivating for staff. They’re either left with an abundance of time in which they are not pushing themselves, or left feeling stressed and demotivated when they fail to complete goals in the time frame provided. 
By setting goals that have these characteristics, you’re setting yourself up for greater success.
SMART goals examples 
Now, let's walk through some SMART goal examples. 
Example 1: 
S. Provide more growth and learning opportunities to each member of my team

M. Give feedback to each member at least 2 times per month

A. Feedback should come from the manager

R. Improves team communication and feedback culture

T. Provided before the end of the next quarter
Example 2: 
S. Have customers complete satisfaction rating surveys at the beginning of their contract and again after two quarters

M. Increase customer satisfaction by 15% over the next two quarters

A. Customer success team to analyze and report improvements every two weeks

R. Become well-known as a company for our focus on customer satisfaction

T. The following 2 quarters

Example 3: 

S. Begin new social media campaign

M. Generate 75 new content downloads

A. Marketing team responsible for running campaign and measuring performance

R. Promote our new feature

T. In the next two months
2. Write them down
Don’t just daydream about your goals — put pen to paper and write them down. This makes your goals more tangible and makes them seem more real.
A study by Dr. Gail Matthews of Dominican University of California shows the effectiveness of writing down goals. According to his research, people who write their goals have a better chance of accomplishing more than those who do not write down their goals.

3. Make your goals visible
To keep your eyes on the prize, put your written goals somewhere you’ll see them. It should be a place you visit regularly so that you’re constantly reminded of where you want to be.
If it’s your personal goals, put them on your bathroom mirror or fridge as a nudge every morning of what you want to achieve.
For teams, your group goals should be somewhere all your team members can see them. This could be a bulletin board or incorporated online into your group management software.
4. Break it down
Because goals are often long-term and abstract by nature, make them more digestible by breaking them down.
Use a “goal ladder” by writing your main goal at the top rung of the ladder. Work your way through the rest of the ladder steps, writing down the smaller goals you need to achieve in order to achieve your main goal.
5. Develop a plan
Now that you know what you’re working toward, it’s time to figure out how you’re going to get there.
Write down the individual steps you need to take to achieve goals. Creating an action plan will keep you on track. As you work your way through each step of your plan, cross it off so you can see how much further you have to go and feel optimistic about your progress.
6. Take action
Goals aren’t going to achieve themselves. Once you’ve got a clear plan of how you want to achieve your goals, it’s time to get proactive.
Put your plan into action. Even the smallest act makes you one step closer to your goal.
7. Keep perspective
It can be easy to become obsessed with achieving your goals. You might reach a point where you feel you would do anything you have to in order to get closer to achieving your goal.
But this can lead to burnout and even abandonment of your goal.
Avoid burnout by living a balanced life. Take breaks from your plan and look at the bigger picture. Practice kindness toward yourself and give yourself time.
8. Identify potential obstacles
Be realistic in that you’re going to face challenges along the way. Recognize what these problems might be and make a note of them.
Being aware of your potential obstacles will make them less intimidating if you are faced with them along your journey toward success.
9. Be accountable
Trying to accomplish a goal entirely by yourself can be lonely and overwhelming. Accountability helps you make consistent, steady progress and keeps you striving toward your goals.
Keep yourself accountable by sharing your goals with a friend. If it’s a group goal, have your team share their goals with another team.
10. Reflect and adjust
Maybe you haven’t achieved your goals in the time frame you wanted to. Maybe your goals were a bit too unrealistic. And that’s ok.
Rather than feeling defeated, take time to review your goals and see what you can change. You might need to adjust your goals or maybe just tweak your plan to achieve them.
Ready to set life goals and achieve them?
Now that you know how important goals are, it’s time to take the first step toward setting goals and achieving them.
Whether it’s personal goals for yourself or company-driven goals for your team, the goal-setting process can help you find purpose and meaning in your life.
Don’t put too much pressure on yourself and your team members. Even if you don’t reach all of your goals, just having them written down can provide a deeper sense of fulfillment and satisfaction.




Strategies to Achieve Your Goals
#1. Set S.M.A.R.T. Goals
SMART is an acronym that stands for five criteria aimed to help you set strong and attainable goals, achieve them within a reasonable time frame, and measure the results. 
George Doran, Arthur Miller, and James Cunningham developed the acronym, which they published in 1981 in an article titled “There’s a S.M.A.R.T. Way to Write Management’s Goals and Objectives.”  
Although they may have intended these guidelines for business settings, you can actually follow the SMART acronym to set and achieve your goals in any area of your life. 
SMART stands for goals that are: 
* Specific. You want your goals to be as specific as possible. Use questions like who, what, where, when, and why to help you.
* Measurable. Define indicators to help you measure your success (or failure).
* Attainable. Make sure your goals are practical and realistic. A bit further into the article, we’ll give you detailed tips on how to set realistic goals (and why it’s so important).
* Relevant. You want your goals to be in tune with your personality and values. Otherwise, you may wake up one day and understand you’ve been working toward the wrong goal.
* Time-bound. Set a clear timeframe for achieving your goal in order not to postpone it indefinitely.
In a nutshell, having SMART goals consists of getting very detailed about what you want to achieve. In turn, this can increase your chances of success by helping you work smarter instead of harder.   
#2. Create an Action Plan
Having and abiding by an action plan is essential if you want to achieve your goals. 
Let’s assume, for example, that you are a recent graduate whose goal is to write a science fiction novel. This is, without a doubt, a long-term goal that requires daily work and effort to achieve.
Without an action plan in place, you may postpone your writing indefinitely. 
You may get distracted, blame the writer’s block, postpone writing until you’re “inspired,” and before you know it, ten years may pass without writing a single word. 
With a detailed action plan that outlines exactly what you need to do, on the other hand, it will be much easier to follow through with your goal. Your brain won't be overwhelmed by the effort it takes to write a book if you have a concrete plan in place that you will follow day in and day out. 
Here are some steps you can take to define your own action plan: 
* Define your end goal (you can use the SMART method outlined above to do that).
* List all the steps you need to follow.
* Prioritize your tasks and add deadlines for each task.
* Set milestones (e.g. finishing each chapter, proofreading the book, sending it to publishers, etc.).
* Identify any necessary resources. What will it take you to achieve your goal, in terms of time, money, connections, skills, etc.? How many of these resources do you possess and is any of them an obstacle?
* Monitor, evaluate, and update. Once you start working on your action plan, you may notice that you’ve miscalculated certain steps, milestones, or resources. This, however, is nothing to worry about - no one can predict the future. If something like that happens, simply readjust your plans accordingly.
#3. Break Bad Habits 
Do you pull all-nighters when you need to do deep work and end up looking like a zombie for two days in a row? Do you like partying a little too much? 
Or, maybe, you’re one of those people who think multitasking is some sort of superpower (although it really isn’t). 
No matter what your bad habits are, it’s important to work hard on fighting them if you want to achieve your goals. 
If your goal is to get promoted at work, for example, but you’re an avid procrastinator who barely finishes your work on time, chances are that your boss will promote someone else. 
Here are some tried-and-tested ways to break your bad habits: 
* Become fully aware of your bad habits (writing them down can help here)
* Visualize yourself overcoming a tempting situation
* Replace bad habits with healthy ones (e.g. partying with exercising)
* Identify your triggers
* Ask a friend for help
We know, we know. Saying “break bad habits” is really easier said than done. There are, however, no shortcuts or hacks here. 95% of the work is going to have to come from you.
#4. Work On Your Self-Discipline
Self-discipline is what makes the difference between an achiever and a dreamer. 
Albert Einstein once said  “genius is 1% talent and 99% hard work” and we couldn’t agree more!
It takes self-discipline to actually sit down and put in the hard work. Most people simply want to enjoy the benefits hard work brings, which is why they get disappointed when they can’t achieve their goals. 
For a self-disciplined person, nothing seems impossible. For someone who lacks discipline, on the other hand, even the easiest and most mundane tasks can seem difficult and a waste of time. They may have big goals but lack the grit to sit down and work for them. 
You can improve your self-discipline by incorporating healthy habits in your life, such as:
* Waking up and starting your day early
* Eating healthy and exercising regularly
* Establishing a sleep routine
* Working a set number of hours daily
#5. Eliminate Distractions
Distractions are, arguably, the number one enemy of productivity and progress. However, our world is filled with distractions, from social media notifications to information overload. 
If you’re constantly distracted from the daily work you need to do to achieve your goals, your progress will get derailed and you’ll get almost nothing done. Be it a noisy TV in the background, your roommates or coworkers, or your social media notifications, it’s important to eliminate distractions if you want to achieve your goals (sooner rather than later). 
Here are some ways you can effectively eliminate distractions and focus on your to-dos: 
* When you’re working on your goals, silence any notifications and alerts that aren’t directly related to the task at hand.
* Use headphones to avoid distracting background noise. If music is also distracting to you, try putting on white noise or nature sounds.
* Go to a coworking space/the library. Seeing others also focused on work is a great way to get into the zone and get things done.
* Leverage productivity apps. To-Doist is a great app for managing your day-to-day to-dos. Similarly, Chrome extensions like StayFocused restrict distracting sites on your laptop, thus helping you stay focused on your work.
#6. Leverage Daily or Monthly Targets
Chances are, some of your goals are long-term. For example, becoming the CEO of a company, buying a house, owning a business, etc. 
Well, such big goals can get very overwhelming, very fast. 
That’s why, to achieve long-term goals, it’s essential to split them up into bite-sized daily goals. Think about what you need to do daily to meet that overarching, future objective.
Say, for example, that your goal is to write a sci-fi novel in the next five years. Some milestones you can set for this goal may be:
* Becoming more knowledgeable about science
* Reading world-famous sci-fi novels
* Improving your writing skills
Based on these milestones, you can set different daily goals for yourself, such as:
* Write 1,000 words a day
* Spend two hours a day reading sci-fi books
* Spend one hour a day reading scientific studies
#7. Avoid Procrastination
Procrastination is something many people struggle with. Heck, 25% of adults even consider it to be a personality trait. 
If you’re one of them, procrastination can seriously get in the way of achieving your goals. Always postponing everything that you need to do until the last moment will result in low-quality results, more effort spent, and a whole lot of disappointment. 
Here are some effective ways to avoid procrastination: 
* Schedule your deep work. Deep work is the time you devote to your most important, time-consuming, personal work.
* Take breaks frequently. Nobody can be productive for seven hours straight. Let your mind wind down every once in a while to make sure that when you’re sitting to work, you actually work.
* Acknowledge your negative feelings. Address feelings of fear, anxiety, or frustration that may be causing you to procrastinate.
* Hone your organizational skills.  The more organized you are, the more effectively you can tackle your tasks and meet impending deadlines.
#8. Anticipate Obstacles
The better you’re able to identify possible obstacles to your goals, the easier it will be to tackle them and overcome them. 
Here are some steps you can follow to identify potential obstacles to your goals: 
* Brainstorm all possible obstacles.
* Categorize the obstacles into “no control,” “influence,” and “direct control.” Put obstacles over which you have no control in the first category, obstacles over which you may have some influence in the second, and obstacles over which you have direct control in the third.
* Remove obstacles over which you have no control from the list.
* Prioritize the “direct control” and “influence” obstacles accordingly.
* For obstacles you have direct control over, prioritize them by the easiest to address. For the ones where you have some influence over, prioritize them based on their impact on your goal.
* Develop an action plan to address each obstacle.
#9. Seek Out Inspiration 
When you’re striving to achieve big, long-term goals, it’s not common to get discouraged every now and then. 
This may happen due to several reasons, including the obstacles you may face along the way, fear of failure, lack of focus, or even the inability to handle negative emotions like anxiety or fear. 
To make sure that your discouragement doesn’t become a reason to quit your goals, you should seek out daily doses of inspiration. 
Continuous inspiration can help keep you motivated, focused, and driven. It can also help you combat discouragement and negative thoughts, whenever they occur. 
Now, different people seek different types of inspiration. For some, motivational TED talks may be enough to keep them focused and inspired.  Others perform better with a mentor to guide them on how they should meet their goals.
As such, you should think about what motivates you and find the right source of inspiration for YOU. 
#10. Track Your Progress
When you track your progress systematically, you’re much more likely to achieve your goals. 
When you track your progress you are able to evaluate how your action plan is doing, how effectively you’re addressing obstacles, whether you need to readjust your targets or timeframe, etc. 
Tracking your progress should be fairly easy if you follow the SMART goal-setting method outlined above and have a detailed action plan in place. With measurable, realistic goals, you can set up a system (or KPIs) to track your progress much more easily than if your goal is something vague like “have a lot of money someday.” 
For example, a simple way to track your progress is to check your action plan. Are you meeting the milestones you’ve set for yourself in the expected time frame or is it taking you longer? 
Are you facing unexpected obstacles along the way that are setting you back? If that’s the case, you may need to readjust your action plan. 
#11. Manage Your Time Effectively 
When it comes to achieving your goals, time can be your ally or it can be your enemy, all depending on how you manage it.
If you’re prone to mismanaging your time, you’ll likely feel like there will never be enough of it to achieve your goals. With strong management skills, on the other hand, you’ll likely even have time to spare at the end of each day. 
That said, time management is easier said than done. To do it as effectively as possible, it helps to have a time-management system in place.
For example, you can adopt the quadrant time management system, which divides time into four boxes based on the urgency of the tasks you have to complete: 
* Important and urgent. These are short-term crises and problems you need to deal with ASAP.
* Important but not urgent. These are the long-term strategic goals you need to work on consistently.
* Urgent but not important. These are easy but short-term tasks you can accomplish by avoiding distractions and interruptions.
* Not urgent and not important. Misc stuff you have to do. Put these on the bottom of your to-do lists.
Alternatively, you can head over to our comprehensive guide on improving time-management skills to learn about many more effective strategies to manage YOUR time. 
#12. Hold Yourself Accountable 
Last but not least, you should be able to hold yourself accountable if you want to achieve your goals.
This means accepting failure now and then, facing setbacks head-on, and not making excuses for yourself. Holding yourself accountable is an important mindset that you should incorporate into your life to make all the strategies mentioned above tangible. 
In the long run, accountability is what sets action apart from mere dreams and talk. 
5 Benefits of Having Goals
Having goals and working toward achieving them is definitely a challenging undertaking. 
Even if you follow all the strategies for achieving your goals outlined in this article, chances are there will be moments when the going gets tough and you feel like quitting.  
When that happens, it helps to focus on how beneficial goals are for your personal and professional life. 
Specifically, here are some of the top benefits of having goals that you should keep in mind: 
1. Motivation. Setting goals will give you something to aspire to, which, in turn, can serve as a strong motivator to always try your hardest. Is your goal to be the best professional in your field? That alone should motivate you to always show up and give it all you’ve got in the workplace.
2. Control. Goal setting means you’re acknowledging exactly what it is that you want in life. That is the first step towards making things happen, instead of simply letting them happen to you.
3. Sense of direction. Your goals can offer you a clear direction for your short-term and long-term future. Is your goal to become a doctor? Then your path is going through med school, studying hard, and dedicating your life to helping others.
4. Clarity. When you set goals, it’s easier to see the bigger picture and gain perspective on what really matters to YOU. If your goal in life is, say, to help people, then you won’t feel unfulfilled or disappointed if you don’t advance your career or make tons of money.
5. Focus. Having goals can help you stay focused on your day-to-day tasks. When we think abstractly about our dreams, they often remain exactly that—dreams. When we have goals, however, it’s easier to put in the effort to achieve them and avoid distractions and feeling overwhelmed.
How to Set Realistic Goals for Your Work and Your Life
Whether you’re setting goals for your professional or your personal life, it’s important to keep them realistic; otherwise, it may be very hard (or even impossible) to achieve them.  
An example of an unrealistic goal is wanting to become a mathematician when you’re bad at math. Or, aiming to graduate with an above-average GPA without studying. 
An example of a realistic goal, on the other hand, is to become a renowned professor once you have shown academic potential. At work, it can be getting promoted after meeting your job’s KPIs. 
Here are some tips for setting realistic and attainable goals in all aspects of your life: 
#1. Consider your passions
Working toward a goal for which you’re not passionate is bound to be boring and bound to backfire. 
That’s why it’s important to consider your passions, values, and aspirations when you’re setting goals. If, for example, you’re someone who isn’t driven by material gains, setting a goal to make as much money as possible may prove to be disappointing and uninspiring to you. 
#2. Envision your future 
Where do you see yourself in five, ten, or fifteen years? 
What does your ideal future look like? 
Taking some time to envision your future based on who you are today is essential in setting personal and professional goals. 
Some other questions that can help you get a clearer idea of your future include: 
* Do you want to work for yourself?
* How much money do you want to earn, ideally?
* Would you like to work remotely?
* Do you want to focus on your family or career?
* Do you see yourself having children? 
* Would you like to spend some time traveling or living somewhere abroad?
#3. Note your resources and potential threats 
Think long and hard about the resources you have available that can help you achieve your goals and the threats that may make it difficult to do so. 
Examples of such resources include the time at your disposal, how informed you are about what achieving your goal requires, whether you’re trained (or have the right skills), if you have or need support, funding, or monetary resources, etc. 
Let’s say that your goal is to get into an Ivy League school. The resources you may have at your disposal to achieve your goal may be that you’re well-informed, that you’re an excellent student, and that you have your parents' and teachers’ support. 
Potential threats, on the other hand, might be low-acceptance rates and very high tuition fees.  
#4. Reassess and adjust
Once you have considered your passions and values, envisioned your future, and made a detailed assessment of resources and potential threats, you can reassess your goals and adjust them accordingly. 
Let’s say, for example, that you’re passionate about basketball and you want your professional life to revolve around it. However, you’re not a great athlete, which means that your childhood dream of becoming a professional basketball player is not realistic. 
A reassessed goal, in this case, would be to become a sports journalist if you have a knack for writing, or a sports photographer if you’re better at taking pictures. Alternatively, you may decide to make basketball your number one hobby and play daily after work as a way to let off steam and enjoy yourself.

Q — 
4. What can you do if you have no goals? 
If you feel like you have no goals, that’s totally OK. It’s not uncommon not to have any goals - typically, it comes as a result of now knowing exactly what it is that you want out of life yet.
If that’s you, here are some tips on how to figure out your goals in life.
First things first, you should get to know yourself better. What are you passionate about? What do you love doing, what are your hobbies? What type of skills do you possess? If your hobbies and your skills align, that’s a great place to start.
Secondly, you should envision your future. Where do you see yourself personally and professionally in the future? Is there something you really want to have or dream of achieving by the time you’re a certain age? That can very well be your goal.
If you don’t have any hobbies or passions yet, start researching different fields and trying new things to see what clicks. Alternatively, talk with friends and family about their goals in life - you may find a great source of inspiration among them. 
Q — 
5. What is the difference between goals and targets?
Goals can be defined as people’s primary ambitions and, although they can be short-term, they typically represent some of our most important desires in life. Targets, on the other hand, are specific desired outcomes that can help us achieve our goals. 
To give you an example - a professional goal can be someday owning your own medical practice. In this case, some targets would be finishing med school, buying the right property, establishing a strong client base, etc.
